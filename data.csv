El Salvador stored the cold wallet ""in a physical vault within our national territory,"" he said, including a photo of a wallet that held 5,689.68 BTC, worth $411 million at Thursday's prices.A bitcoin treasury of that size places El Salvador's holdings far higher than previously believed. Even on Thursday, public trackers place the nation's trove at less than 3,000 BTC ($205 million). Earlier this week Buckle teased that the country was not simply buying BTC but also getting it by selling passports,  through currency conversions for businesses, from mining and from government services.The revelation represents the first time that Bukele has tied his nation's holdings to a specific address. He previously relied solely on social media posts to make claims about the size of his trove, providing occasional updates whenever El Salvador bought more.El Salvador became the first country to purchase bitcoin as a treasury asset in September 2021, when a single coin cost around $52,000. On Thursday BTC prices were north of $72,000, though in the past 24 hours the asset has traded above $73,000 and as low as $68,000.The on-chain transfers into El Salvador's cold wallet occurred over the past week, though the majority arrived Thursday.

Bitcoin reached a new all-time high for the first time since 2021, the halving is almost a month away and Ethereum is back over $4,000. Meanwhile, DOGEs, SHIBs, dogs wif hats and memecoins continue to rally. Are you not entertained?When tokens start going up and volatility accelerates, traders often take on new strategies and move to new platforms to capture the freshly minted value in the market. Rather than seek alternative investment strategies like providing liquidity and running the risk of impermanent loss, traders will often give up their precious yield and return to classic buy/sell/hold trading.While the possibility of getting a 10x return during a bull run may be more appealing than a consistent 10% return from liquidity pools, you shouldn’t have to choose between the potential or the inevitable. If you’re deploying capital in Radix right now, you can get both.Radix recently launched its first liquidity campaign event, Project Ignition, bringing $10 million in liquidity incentives for LPs to claim trading fees while gaining significant protection against impermanent loss. Users providing liquidity to USDC, USDT, wBTC and ETH pools will now be able to boost liquidity on leading Radix DEXs like Ociswap, CaviarNine and DefiPlaza. Rest assured that you will receive up to 20% of the provided value instantly in XRD as a bonus in addition to having each dollar of liquidity you add matched with an equal amount of XRD.Project Ignition also provides significant protection from impermanent loss. If an LP provides a crypto that outperforms XRD, that liquidity provider is guaranteed up to 4x protection for asset outperformance. That means Ociswap users can generate around 9% yield on your wBTC/XRD liquidity position, plus 23% in SPLASH and reclaim any impermanent loss in XRD tokens.To participate in the liquidity campaign, you need to provide liquidity on any of Radix-partnered DEXs by bridging assets through Instabridge. Alternatively, if you’re a Radix Wallet user or already an ecosystem Radvocate, you can swap your assets via a Radix-based DEX. For more information on how to get going with Instabridge, check out these Radix Wallet setup guides.The next few months will be pivotal not only for the crypto industry as a whole but also for the Radix ecosystem. As Degens and Wall Street traders join together to celebrate the end of crypto winter, it’s time to execute the trading strategies that you’ve mastered over the past few years. With the launch of Project Ignition, you can generate yield on liquidity pools without the risk of impermanent loss while also earning XRD and enjoying the season of up only.Learn more about Radix’s Project Ignition, immerse yourself in the Radix ecosystem and lean into the RadFi Summer in 2024.Related: Radix: Innovation For DeFi Summer 2024DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The bank said it disagreed.“Private investors and individuals have propagated both gold and bitcoin year-to-date rather than shifting from the former to the latter,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.“Beyond retail investors, speculative institutional investors such as hedge funds including momentum traders such as CTAs appear to have also propagated the rally by buying both gold and bitcoin futures since February, perhaps more heavily than retail investors,” the authors wrote.The bank’s analysis shows a “sharp position build-up since February of $7b in bitcoin futures and $30b in gold futures.”The risk of mean reversion looks high, the bank said, which means both assets could fall back toward their average levels.Software developer MicroStrategy (MSTR), which has a corporate strategy of buying bitcoin, also played a part in amplifying the rally, the bank said. The company has bought over $1 billion of bitcoin this year, adding to the more than $1 billion acquired in the last quarter of 2023, the report noted.“We believe the debt-funded bitcoin purchases by MicroStrategy add leverage and froth to the current crypto rally and raise the risk of more severe deleveraging in a potential downturn in the future,” the report said.Read more: Bitcoin Is Unlikely to Match Gold’s Allocation in Investors’ Portfolios in Nominal Terms: JPMorganEdited by Sheldon Reback.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Sen. Laphonza Butler (D-CA) write that a FINRA survey disclosed that 70% of brokers’ communications with retail investors violated fair disclosure rules.“Brokers’ communications falsely equated cryptocurrency with cash; in others, they provided misleading explanations of cryptocurrency’s risks,” they wrote. “These alarming deficiencies raise significant concerns that brokers and advisers may now provide incomplete and deceptive information about bitcoin ETPs to retail investors.”The Senators also argue that by naming bitcoin exchange-traded funds as such, the name “obfuscates important characteristics about these investments.”“Retail investors should be made aware of how these ETPs differ from more common funds which they may have experience,” they said in the letter, writing that bitcoin is not subject to the same protections under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that ETFs which hold shares of various companies would have.The two lawmakers also say that bitcoin (BTC) – which they call the most established and scrutinized cryptocurrency – is displaying weakness, and other cryptos are far more susceptible to misconduct.“We do not believe that other cryptocurrencies show the trading volumes or integrity to support associated ETPs,” they wrote. “Retail investors would face enormous risks from ETPs…whose prices are especially susceptible to pump-and-dump or other fraudulent schemes.”Coinbase’s Paul Grewal hits back“Respectfully, Senators, the evidence points exactly the opposite way,” Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal wrote in a post on X.Grewal pointed out that ether (ETH), thought to be the next digital asset to have an ETF, has a higher trading volume than many S&P 500 stocks.“ETH’s spot market is deep and liquid,” he wrote. “Only one S&P 500 stock has lower adjusted bid-ask spreads,” Grewal added that Coinbase had addressed the senators’ concerns when it sent a 27-page comment letter to the SEC.“Crypto is an important building block in updating our financial system for everyone,” he concluded.Edited by Parikshit Mishra.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

However, prices are still up 60% year-to-date, CoinDesk data shows. Nvidia has pulled back 9% from its lifetime peak of $974 but still boasts a year-to-date gain of 77.5%.In five years, bitcoin’s market capitalization has jumped to $1.43 trillion from $70 billion. Similarly, Nvidia’s market value has increased to over $2 trillion from around $100 billion.The growing demand for Nvidia processors from ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (AI) projects has been primarily responsible for the surge in the chip makers’ valuations.The 90-day correlation coefficient between the two has risen to 0.86, the highest since May 2023, having flipped positive in November, according to charting platform TradingView. The 52-week correlation has been consistently positive since July 2020 and has now risen to 0.88, the highest since January 2023.A coefficient of over 0.80 indicates that bitcoin and NVDA are highly correlated and tend to move in the same direction.52-week correlation between BTC and NVDA. (TradingView/CoinDesk) (TradingView/CoinDesk)The statistical relationship is noteworthy, as some market observers, including investment management firm GMO, worry that the AI frenzy is similar to the dot-com bubble burst in 2000.The launch of ChatGPT in December 2022 helped raise general awareness about artificial intelligence, and the subsequent love affair with AI stocks represents a “bubble within a bubble,” which could start to deflate,” GMO’s Chief Investment Strategist Jeremy Grantham explained in a paper published on Monday. Both bitcoin and Wall Street’s tech-heavy Nasdaq index bottomed out in December 2022.“Every technological revolution like this [AI] – going back from the internet to telephones, railroads, or canals – has been accompanied by early massive hype and a stock market bubble as investors focus on the ultimate possibilities of the technology, pricing most of the very long-term potential immediately into current market prices,” Grantham noted, calling AI a bubble.“And many such revolutions are, in the end, often as transformative as those early investors could see and sometimes even more so – but only after a substantial period of disappointment during which the initial bubble bursts,” Grantham added.Meanwhile, strategists at Citi said AI is the bubble but could last into 2025, according to Investing.com.Edited by Parikshit Mishra.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The cryptocurrency had rallied about 50% over the past month, in sync with the 49% rise over the same time period in the benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index of the largest digital assets.Read More: Arbitrum's ARB, Polygon's MATIC Lead Gains as Ethereum's Dencun Upgrade Goes LiveA key element of the upgrade is to enable a new place for storing data on the blockchain – referred to as ""blobs,"" with a dedicated space that is separate from regular transactions, and at a lower cost.The upgrade, considered to be Ethereum's biggest in almost a year, has been viewed as a crucial moment in the blockchain's history, ushering in a new era for tackling Ethereum’s notoriously high transaction fees, and could touch off a race among the biggest layer-2 networks to take advantage of the changes in scaling the blockchain.In the official watch party hosted by EthStaker and the Ethereum Foundation, Terence Tsao, core developer of Offchain Labs, noted that some of the bigger rollups are holding off on submitting data blobs to Ethereum until the network is more stable. The X account for the Arbitrum Foundation noted that it would start to make use of blobs in the next 24 hours.The layer-2 network Starknet confirmed the it had started submitting data blobs.At least one casualty was reported, though: The layer-2 network Blast said in a post on X that it had ""stopped producing blocks due to issues related to Ethereum's Dencun upgrade."" A little while later, Blast tweeted that the ""issue has been resolved,"" and that a full analysis would be shared ""shortly.""What is proto-danksharding?Central to the upgrade is the implementation of “proto-danksharding” – a new transaction category that will store data on Ethereum, through the introduction of the data blobs.The primary benefit of this upgrade will not be for Ethereum users themselves, but mainly layer 2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon, who help scale Ethereum by bundling up transactions from users and then passing them back to the main blockchain, where they're settled in big batches.This type of technology is known as a rollup, and rollup networks have skyrocketed in the Ethereum ecosystem over the past few years. Users have deposited billions of dollars in these types of chains, and recently have seen higher transaction volumes compared to the base chain.Once Dencun is implemented, these layer-2s will be able to post data to Ethereum, rather than in the clunky transactional data fields where they are currently posting. The new setup is supposed to make settling data for rollups more efficient and cheaper, which should then trickle down to end-users by reducing their fees too.Dencun is the first step for the blockchain in its quest to implement ""sharding,"" which is a technological feature that will break up the blockchain into mini-shards (or mini-chains), to process more transactions for cheap. The full implementation of sharding is still years away, so Dencun’s implementation of proto-danksharding is an interim solution for Ethereum’s high gas fees.Screenshot of blockchain explorer Beaconcha.in showing first Ethereum blocks after the activation of the Dencun upgrade. (beaconcha.in)Data availability solutionsProto-danksharding is also supposed to benefit a new class of blockchains that have entered the Ethereum ecosystem known as data availability (DA) layers. DA layers like Celestia, EigenDA and Avail help networks store large amounts of data for rollupsDA’s are separate blockchains that handle the task of proving that the data of these transactions exists, and is available if needed. As rollups produce a lot of data – and consume a lot of the data space on Ethereum – the need for DA solutions has become even more crucial. Proto-danksharding therefore could make the costs of downloading DA data cheaper.Ethereum Foundation's Tim Beiko speaks on Dencun watch party. (Ethereum Foundation/YouTube)Layer-2 fee raceAs layer-2 fees are set to drop dramatically among Ethereum’s rollups, there is speculation that this could set up a fee war between many of these auxiliary networks, which will be competing for the same users by offering cheaper transaction fees.How that all will exactly play out is still ambiguous, as the full effect of proto-danksharding can be properly measured once it is implemented.In a recent interview with CoinDesk, Jesse Pollak, creator of Base, the U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase’s layer-2 network, said that without an increase in usage, costs could fall down to 90% to 95%.Every ecosystem will end up deciding how they go about pricing these transaction fees, said Steven Goldfeder, the co-founder of Offchain Labs, the primary developer behind the Arbitrum Network, the largest Ethereum layer-2, based on the crucial metric of total value locked, or TVL – akin to deposits.“Some of our competitors price layer-2 fees at essentially zero,"" Goldfeder said. ""That's not sustainable.”Other layer-2 experts say Dencun will call for more collaboration between rollup projects.“Scalability is the fundamental unlock that enables permissionless collaboration between developers across projects and teams,” said Karl Floersch to CoinDesk, CEO of OP Labs, the developer firm behind the Optimism blockchain. “With EIP-4844 and Dencun, developers across the Ethereum ecosystem can more seamlessly build together. The upgrade will enable a group of loosely coordinated developers to actually build systems that provide overall experiences that will rival the user experiences we’re used to from top-down, centrally planned platforms.”What else is in Dencun?While proto-danksharding is the focus of the Dencun upgrade, there are eight other Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that have made it into the Dencun package that will mostly affect developers:EIP-1153: which helps reduce fees for storing data on-chain, which also improves blockspace.EIP-4788: improves designs for bridges and staking pools.EIP-5656: a small code change that should improve the Ethereum Virtual Machine.EIP-6780: eliminates a code that could terminate smart contracts.EIP-7044: a minor code change that should improve the staking user experience.EIP-7045: expands the attestation slot inclusion range.EIP-7514: will slow down the rate of staking on Ethereum.EIP-7516: helps rollups get information about the cost for blob transactions.Read more: Ethereum Blockchain Counts Down to 'Dencun' Upgrade, Set to Reduce FeesUPDATE (14:28): Updates to state that Dencun upgrade is finalized and adds that some major rollup teams may be waiting to start sending blobs.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The Qatar Investment Authority has denied investing. But, with BTC increasingly accepted on Wall Street, sovereign funds may add digital assets to their portfolios soon. In recent days, rumors have resurfaced surrounding Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund making a major investment into Bitcoin.During the cryptocurrency’s ride up to an all time high of $69,000, analysts noticed a new wallet holding more than 50,000 BTC (over $3.3 billion). Referred to as “Mr 100” due to multiple daily purchases of 100 BTC over several weeks, many have wondered if this could be the nation looking to diversify its sovereign wealth fund’s portfolio, a secret billionaire or a bank accumulating BTC ahead of launching an ETF.The $500b tweetSpeculation began in December 2023, following a tweet by Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser, suggesting that the QIA (Qatar Investment Authority) could make a $500bn investment into Bitcoin.Keiser, known for his work on El Salvador's Bitcoin strategy, hinted at a seismic market impact. This claim stirred a frenzy across social media, helping push BTC higher.“I have 1 word for you $100,000 Bitcoin God Candle fans. QATAR, the rumors are getting very loud on this. Their [sovereign wealth fund is] looking to buy ½ trillion BTC,” (sic), Keiser said on X.Just days ago, Anthony Scaramucci added fuel to the fire by replying to Keiser’s most recent tweet, saying “It’s happening!!!”.The Skybridge Capital founder, who recently predicted Bitcoin will reach at least $170,000 post halving next month, wrote on X: “Max is saying Qatar may have added BTC to its balance sheet. If true all we can say is thank you Max Keiser!”.Evidence for the claim is circumstantial: the Qatar Executive Gulfstream G650ER, the private jet of The Emir of Qatar, was spotted flying into the Bitcoin Atlantis conference in Madeira at the start of the month.Amid the speculation, experts argue that government-level investments in Bitcoin are becoming increasingly plausible. CoinDesk contacted the QIA for comment. While representatives at QIA remain tight-lipped about specific investment moves, they reaffirmed a focus on blockchain technology over direct cryptocurrency investments.Speaking to CoinDesk, Talal Tabbaa, CEO of CoinMENA, the first regional cryptocurrency exchange to enter the Qatari market, highlighted a shifting landscape where even sovereign states might view Bitcoin as a viable component of their financial strategy.“With BlackRock acquiring over 200,000 Bitcoin in the past six weeks, it's perfectly normal for any government to consider allocating a serious amount of money to bitcoin,""  he said.A closer look at the numbersThe initial rumored investment of $500 billion is bigger than the QIA's reported institutional holdings of $475 billion assets under management (AUM), making the investment unlikely.For comparison, MicroStrategy holds an estimated 205,000 BTC, worth an estimated $14 billion at current prices. It has acquired this amount slowly over several years. A $500 billion purchase, as rumored by Keiser, would be logistically difficult, as every purchase requires a seller.Obvious questions arise regarding the prospect of even being able to acquire what amounts to about 40% of Bitcoin’s current total market cap. The world’s largest wallet, owned by world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, holds only about $14 billion worth of BTC.Yet, as Tabbaa says,it is impossible to rely on speculated dollar numbers as a gauge for potential Bitcoin investment or not, adding that there is ‘‘no way to sense, check or validate them.’’CEO of the QIA, Mansoor bin Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud, previously stated in 2022 that the fund has no interest in cryptocurrency investments. However, Tabbaa warns against viewing regulatory caution as a blanket stance against all forms of digital asset investments, suggesting a potential distinction between public regulatory positions and private investment strategies.“Financial regulators aim to protect investors, while investment funds, whether  sovereign or non-sovereign, are looking for return and it would make sense to buy Bitcoin in that case,” Tabbaa said.Qatar's crypto regulatory landscapeCryptocurrency has not been legalized in Qatar. The Central Bank of Qatar has made trading Bitcoin illegal due to its volatility and alleged potential for financial crime and lack of underlying assets. Officials cite the need to safeguard the financial system and ensure economic stability.Qatar is laying the groundwork for a sophisticated regulatory framework dedicated to digital assets, with a focus on investment tokens that are tied to tangible underlying assets. Notably absent from this framework are stablecoins, CBDCs and other forms of cryptocurrency.Tabbaa said that despite the cautious regulatory approach from Qatar, the MENA region, led by the UAE and Bahrain, has made progressive steps to position itself as a ""global crypto hub,"" with Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), being the world’s first independent crypto regulator and Abu Dhabi driving bitcoin mining for the region.“The U.S. took arguably the biggest step with ETFs, but I am super optimistic on digital asset growth in the region,” Tabbaa said.Separating fact from fictionQatar's rumored Bitcoin investment underscores the crypto world's susceptibility to speculative chatter. Qatar’s regulatory stance and the country’s recent financial commitments suggest that a $500 billion investment in Bitcoin in the short term is unlikely and feasibly impossible.Nevertheless, many are left pondering the identity of “Mr 100” and if there is any truth to the speculation. Are the rumors based on nothing but hearsay and fantasy? Or do they show Qatar moving in a direction of embracing crypto assets more strongly?Edited by Benjamin Schiller and Marc Hochstein.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

13,"Bitcoin Halving, Explained",https://www.coindesk.com/learn/bitcoin-halving-explained/,"LearnBitcoin Halving, ExplainedBitcoin Halving, ExplainedImage: ShutterstockBitcoin Halving, ExplainedThe last Bitcoin halving took place on May 11, 2020, and the next bitcoin halving will likely occur in April 2024. But what is the halving, how does it affect the price, and what does it mean for miners and the cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects?By Alyssa HertigUpdated Mar 8, 2024 at 4:41 p.m. UTCShare on FacebookShare on LinkedInShare on XBeginnerThe Bitcoin halving, which is also known as “the halvening,” is the name for one of the most hotly anticipated events in Bitcoin’s history.In May 2020, the number of bitcoin (BTC) entering circulation every 10 minutes – known as block rewards – dropped by half, from 12.5 to 6.25. It’s a milestone that was easy to see coming because it happens every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years) and had happened twice before 2020.The allure of possible riches is what draws so much attention to these events. The number of new bitcoin entering circulation shrinks, but demand should, in theory, stay the same, possibly driving up the bitcoin’s price. And so the event has inspired passionate debate about bitcoin price predictions and how the market will respond.“The theory is that there will be less bitcoin available to buy if miners have less to sell,” said Michael Dubrovsky, a co-founder of PoWx, a crypto research nonprofit.But the periodic decline in Bitcoin’s minting rate could have a deeper significance than any near-term price movements for the functioning of the currency. The block reward is an important component of Bitcoin, one that ensures the security of this leaderless system. As the rewards dwindle to zero in the decades ahead, it could potentially destabilize the economic incentives underlying bitcoin’s security.For those trying to make sense of this complex topic, here’s everything you need to know.What is the bitcoin halving?New bitcoins enter circulation as block rewards, produced by the efforts of “miners” who use expensive electronic equipment to earn, or “mine,” them.Roughly every four years, the total number of bitcoin that miners can potentially win is halved.Bitcoin supply and subsidy.In 2009, the system rewarded successful miners with 50 bitcoin every 10 minutes. Three halvings later, 6.25 bitcoins are being dispensed every 10 minutes.Learn More: How the ‘Halving’ Could Impact BitcoinThe process will end once the number of bitcoin in circulation reaches 21 million. A popular estimate is that it will occur sometime near the year 2140.Who chose the Bitcoin distribution schedule? Why?Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who may have been an individual or a team, disappeared about a year after he, she or they released the software into the world. So, he or she or they (we’ll just go with “they” from now on) are no longer around to explain why they chose this specific formula for adding new bitcoin into circulation.But early emails written by Nakamoto shed some light on the mysterious figure’s (figures’) thinking.Shortly after releasing the Bitcoin white paper, Nakamoto summarized the various ways their chosen monetary policy (the schedule by which miners receive block rewards) could play out, pondering the circumstances under which it could lead to deflation (when a currency’s purchasing power increases) or inflation (when the prices of goods and services purchasable with a currency increase).Learn More: Who Is Satoshi Nakamoto?At the time, Nakamoto couldn’t have known how many people would use the new digital money (if anyone).They elaborated very little on why they chose the particular formula they did: “Coins have to get initially distributed somehow, and a constant rate seems like the best formula,” the wrote.Total circulation will be 21,000,000 coins. It’ll be distributed to network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half every 4 years. first 4 years: 10,500,000 coins next 4 years: 5,250,000 coins next 4 years: 2,625,000 coins next 4 years: 1,312,500 coins etc...Satoshi NakamotoWith most state-issued currencies a central bank, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, has tools at its disposal that enable it to add or remove dollars from circulation. If the economy is floundering, for instance, the Fed can increase circulation and encourage lending by purchasing securities from banks. Alternately, if the Fed wants to remove dollars from the economy, it can sell securities from its account.For better or worse, bitcoin is a bit different. For one, the supply schedule is all but set in stone.Unlike the monetary policy of state-issued currencies, which unfolds through political processes and human institutions, Bitcoin’s monetary policy is written into code shared across the network. Changing it would require an immense output of coordination and agreement across the community of Bitcoin users.“Unlike most national currencies we’re familiar with like dollars or euros, bitcoin was designed with a fixed supply and predictable inflation schedule. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. This predetermined number makes them scarce, and it’s this scarcity alongside their utility that largely influences their market value,” crypto wallet company Blockchain.com wrote in a blog post ahead of the 2016 halving.Another unique aspect of Bitcoin is Nakamoto programmed the block reward to decrease over time. That is another way in which it differs from the norm for modern financial systems, where central banks control the money supply. In stark contrast to Bitcoin’s halving block reward, the supply of the dollar has roughly tripled since 2000.Nakamoto left clues that they created Bitcoin for political reasons. The first Bitcoin block features the headline of a newspaper article: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”Many have come to interpret that statement as a sign of Nakamoto’s political beliefs and goals. If widely adopted, Bitcoin could potentially reduce the power banks and governments have over monetary policy, including bailouts of struggling institutions. As shown with the block reward, no central entity can create bitcoin outside of the strict schedule.How does halving influence bitcoin’s price?A bitcoin halving grabs so much attention mostly because many believe it will lead to a price increase. The truth is, no one knows what's going to happen.Bitcoin has seen three halvings so far, which we can look to as precedents.The 2012 halving provided the first demonstration of how markets would respond to Nakamoto’s unorthodox supply schedule. Until then, the Bitcoin community didn’t know how a sudden decline in rewards would affect the network. As it turned out, the price began to rise shortly after the halving.The second halving in 2016 was highly anticipated, with CoinDesk running a live blog of the event and Blockchain.com putting out a “countdown.” Each halving has encouraged vigorous speculation about how the event would affect bitcoin’s price.On July 16, 2016, the day of the second halving, the price dropped by 10 percent to $610, but then shot back up to where it was before.Learn More: Bitcoin’s Third Halving ArrivesAlthough the immediate impact on the price of bitcoin was small, the market did eventually respond over the course of the year following the second halving. Some argue that the increase was a delayed result of the halving. The theory is that when the supply of bitcoin declines, the demand for bitcoin will stay the same, pushing the price up. Looking at bitcoin’s price 365 days after the second halving, we can see it rose by 284% to $2,506.Looking at the most recent halving, we can also see bitcoin’s price continued to perform bullishly a full year after the event took place. This time, it rose by more than 559%.Why do miners get these rewards?Bitcoin wouldn’t work at all without block rewards.As pseudonymous independent researcher Hasu put it, there are two parts to making Bitcoin work. “Bitcoin’s ledger state should answer the question of ‘who owns what, when?’” Hasu told CoinDesk.The first part, “who owns what?” is solved by cryptography. Only the owner of a private key (which is like a secret access code) can spend the bitcoin.The game theory that secures Bitcoin requires that a) miners have an incentive to mine honest blocks [and] b) miners have a cost ... to attempting dishonesty.“The second half (‘when?’) is the big challenge and was unsolved before Bitcoin,” Hasu explained. Otherwise, it’s easy for people to “double-spend” their coins, effectively creating money from thin air.Without the block rewards, the network would be in chaos. Hasu explains that if they have enough computing power, miners can attack the network in two ways: By double-spending coins or by stopping transactions from going through. But they are strongly incentivized not to try either, because then they would risk losing their block rewards.“The game theory that secures Bitcoin requires that a) miners have an incentive to mine honest blocks [and] b) miners have a cost ... to attempting dishonesty,” Dubrovsky said.In other words, miners will lose money if they don’t follow the rules.The more computing power miners direct toward Bitcoin, the harder it is to attack the network because an attacker would need to have a significant portion of this processing power, known as the hashrate, to execute such an attack.The more money they can earn by way of block rewards, the more mining power goes to Bitcoin, and thus the more protected the network is.What happens when block rewards get very small or taper off entirely?That is why the periodic decrease in rewards might eventually become an issue.Miners need an incentive to do what they do. They need to get paid. They’re not running these expensive, electricity-guzzling computers for their health after all.But the consequence of the decline in block rewards is that eventually, it will dwindle to nothing. Transaction fees, which users pay each time they send a transaction, are the other way miners earn money. (Theoretically, these fees are optional, although as a practical matter, a transaction without one might have to wait a long time to be processed if the network is congested; the size of the fee is set by the user or their wallet software.) The fees are expected to become a more important source of remuneration for miners as the block reward falls.“In a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for nodes. I’m sure that in 20 years, there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume,” Nakamoto wrote.But for a long time, Bitcoin researchers have been considering the possibility that transaction fees won’t suffice. For one thing, it means transactions might need to grow more expensive over time to keep the network secure.It’s impossible to predict what will happen, but if we want a system that could last 100 years, we should be ready for the worst case.“This cannot really work without very expensive transaction costs because Bitcoin cannot process huge quantities of transactions on-chain,” Dubrovsky said.And, as discussed above, it is mining rewards that draw more computing power to Bitcoin, hardening it against attacks that try to circumvent the network’s rules. It’s unclear whether a future attenuated block reward will have the same allure for miners, even when supplemented with fees.“I don’t think this halving will make Bitcoin significantly less secure, but in eight to 12 years, we could find ourselves in hot water,” Hasu said.Part of the problem is that more than a decade after Bitcoin’s birth the market is still figuring out the true cost of protecting the network from attackers.“Nobody knows the correct level of security needed to keep Bitcoin safe. Currently, Bitcoin pays out something like $5 billion per year and there are no successful attacks; however, there has been no price discovery. Bitcoin may be overpaying. To really find out the minimum level of security needed to avoid attacks, the mining rewards would need to be dropped to the point where attacks start happening and then increased until the attacks stop,” Dubrovsky argued.“Of course, this would be catastrophic for Bitcoin as it’s designed now, but it could really come to some kind of scenario like this if rewards dwindle and the Bitcoin community doesn’t do anything about it,” he added.Hasu said he “hopes” transaction fees will be enough to incentivize the security of Bitcoin in the end, but he thinks it's worth anticipating the “worst case.”“It should be clear that the incentive to attack Bitcoin today is larger than it was five years ago. We now have [former U.S. President Donald] Trump, [China President Xi Jinping] and other world leaders talking critically about it. The more Bitcoin grows, the more they might see it as a threat and might eventually feel forced to react. That would be the worst case, anyway,” Hasu said.This question is an interesting one to ponder when thinking about Bitcoin’s future prospects, though it might sound like a far-off matter.“It’s impossible to predict what will happen, but if we want a system that could last 100 years, we should be ready for the worst case,” Hasu said. “The worst case is demand for block space does not increase in the dramatic fashion that would be needed. As a result, block rewards would eventually trend toward zero.”Updated 10/06/2021 to reflect the most recent bitcoin halving, which took place on May 11, 2020.Updated 2/13/2024 to reflect the upcoming bitcoin halving, which will likely take place in April, 2024.This article was originally published on Oct 4, 2022 at 3:04 p.m. UTCDisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

It allows users to create their own layer 2 networks and drives the value of its native BVM tokens.Developers told CoinDesk that the team plans ""juicy"" airdrops for BVM stakers, which could fuel demand for the tokens.Bitcoin Virtual Machine, a protocol founded late February, is gaining traction among traders betting on the general growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem, driving demand for its BVM tokens.Data shows that the project’s BVM tokens have added 35% in the past 24 hours, beating a general market decline. The CoinDesk 20 Index fell 5.3% in the same period. The tokens have surged to $3.5 from an intitial of 20 cents on March 8.The project lets users spin up their own layer-2 networks on the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin and Ethereum are known as layer-1 protocols, and attempts to scale and expand them are layer 2s. While the Ethereum ecosystem has had multiple layer 2 projects aimed at providing faster, cheaper transactions for years, the Bitcoin version really kicked off only in 2023 following the introduction of Ordinals technology.The value propositions for the token are driven by staking rewards for BVM holders and a cut of fees generated by the service, developer @punk3700 told CoinDesk in a direct message interview on X.“We have 40%-50% circulating staked by our holders. Working on a few airdrop deals for BVM stakers,” @punk3700 said. “Some of them could be quite juicy.”On Friday, the team said Naka Chain, a Bitcoin layer-2 build on BVM, will airdrop 10.5 million tokens to BVM token stakers.

However, prices are still up 60% year-to-date, CoinDesk data shows. Nvidia has pulled back 9% from its lifetime peak of $974 but still boasts a year-to-date gain of 77.5%.In five years, bitcoin’s market capitalization has jumped to $1.43 trillion from $70 billion. Similarly, Nvidia’s market value has increased to over $2 trillion from around $100 billion.The growing demand for Nvidia processors from ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (AI) projects has been primarily responsible for the surge in the chip makers’ valuations.The 90-day correlation coefficient between the two has risen to 0.86, the highest since May 2023, having flipped positive in November, according to charting platform TradingView. The 52-week correlation has been consistently positive since July 2020 and has now risen to 0.88, the highest since January 2023.A coefficient of over 0.80 indicates that bitcoin and NVDA are highly correlated and tend to move in the same direction.52-week correlation between BTC and NVDA. (TradingView/CoinDesk) (TradingView/CoinDesk)The statistical relationship is noteworthy, as some market observers, including investment management firm GMO, worry that the AI frenzy is similar to the dot-com bubble burst in 2000.The launch of ChatGPT in December 2022 helped raise general awareness about artificial intelligence, and the subsequent love affair with AI stocks represents a “bubble within a bubble,” which could start to deflate,” GMO’s Chief Investment Strategist Jeremy Grantham explained in a paper published on Monday. Both bitcoin and Wall Street’s tech-heavy Nasdaq index bottomed out in December 2022.“Every technological revolution like this [AI] – going back from the internet to telephones, railroads, or canals – has been accompanied by early massive hype and a stock market bubble as investors focus on the ultimate possibilities of the technology, pricing most of the very long-term potential immediately into current market prices,” Grantham noted, calling AI a bubble.“And many such revolutions are, in the end, often as transformative as those early investors could see and sometimes even more so – but only after a substantial period of disappointment during which the initial bubble bursts,” Grantham added.Meanwhile, strategists at Citi said AI is the bubble but could last into 2025, according to Investing.com.Edited by Parikshit Mishra.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Repeating what's now a familiar pattern, buyers quickly stepped in, with prices rebounding to $70,500 by press time.The largest crypto by market capitalization earlier Thursday hit a new record high just below $74,000, but started to decline at around the beginning of the U.S. trading session.

Still, SOL was slightly up 3% through the day, making it one of the best-performing assets in the CoinDesk 20 Index. which dropped 4%.Digital asset hedge fund QCP Capital said in a Thursday market update that SOL has benefitted from capital rotation as bitcoin's rally seemingly ran to a halt.Multiple analysts noted that BTC could enter a period of consolidation, even with a potential 20% correction in the cards, as the momentum that propelled to fresh record-highs in the past two weeks started to wane.Read more: Beware of Bitcoin's 'Rising Wedge,' Chart Analyst SaysSOL targets record-highsCrypto traders forecasted more gains for SOL targeting its all-time record prices from 2021, breaking above its last key resistance level after cooling off for two months.Digital asset trader Jelle also noted that SOL is also benefiting from rising retail demand for trading Solana-based tokens such as dogwifhat (WIF), one of the meme coins that recently saw eye-watering advances. ""SOL has broken all major levels standing in the way of new all-time highs,"" Jelle said in an X post. ""New retail will flock to solana tokens, and buying SOL is their entry ticket.""Tristan Frizza, founder and CEO of Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Zeta Markets, noted increased network activity on Solana, with decentralized exchanges (DEX) consistently surpassing $2 billion in daily volume since early March.""[Solana's] solid adoption metrics, which signal genuine user activity, suggest that we’re not only witnessing speculative interest but are also poised to see new all-time highs due to this authentic engagement,"" Frizza said in an email.Recently, SOL changed hands at $165, some 35% lower than its 2021 November peak. Its market capitalization, however, is already approaching its $76 billion record due to the asset's expanding supply, also called token inflation.Edited by Nikhilesh De and Stephen Alpher.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

For the moment, at least, that appears to be changing.Thursday morning's Producer Price Index (PPI) for February was yet another data point that perky inflation is proving far stickier than most expected. The government report said PPI was higher by 0.6% last month, doubling the pace in January and also double economist forecasts. The so-called core PPI, which excludes food and energy costs, rose 0.3% in February, a slowdown from 0.5% in January, but ahead of forecasts for 0.2%.Earlier this week, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) also came in faster than anticipated, with inflation ticking up to 3.2% annually and the core rate rising to 3.8%.Previously flirting with dipping below the 4% level earlier this month, the 10-year Treasury yield has new risen to 4.30%. Alongside, the U.S. dollar has broken out a downtrend begun in mid-February to rise about 1% over the past week, including a 0.5% rise on Thursday. All things being equal, higher rates and a rising dollar tend to be a negative for risk assets like bitcoin (BTC).Expectations for far easier monetary policy in 2024 continue to be whittled back. Markets had come into the year anticipating as much as 150 basis points in Fed rate cuts in 2024, with the initial cut to come at next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting. At this point, no one longer expects that, nor is a cut expected at the May meeting. As for June, the odds of lower rates have fallen to roughly 50%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.After about a 70% rise in 2024 to a new record high just shy of $74,000, bitcoin was surely vulnerable to a correction and it could be that the inflation, interest rate and dollar news has given traders an excuse to lighten up. After touching $73,800 earlier Thursday morning, bitcoin slid to as low as $70,650 after the economic data. At press time it was trading at $70,900 down more than 3% over the past 24 hours. The broader CoinDesk 20 Index was lower by just 1.7%, with gains in Solana and Dogecoin helping that gauge's outperformance.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Not so fast. Ethereum, the next biggest crypto asset by market cap, has a case of its own to make.By Sarah Morton, Alex TapscottMar 14, 2024 at 3:45 p.m. UTCBy Sarah Morton, Alex TapscottMar 14, 2024 at 3:45 p.m. UTCShare on FacebookShare on LinkedInShare on XBy Sarah Morton, Alex TapscottMar 14, 2024 at 3:45 p.m. UTCShare on FacebookShare on LinkedInShare on XShare on FacebookShare on LinkedInShare on XWe continue to watch the unprecedented inflows into the spot bitcoin ETFs, as AUM exceeded $55 billion and bitcoin reached “larger than silver” status. Alex Tapscott, author of Web3: Charting the Internet's Next Economic and Cultural Frontier, outlines that while bitcoin is getting all the attention, Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is evolving and has different investment criteria.With talk of a possible ETH ETF approval in May and renewed interest in bitcoin and crypto, Adam Blumberg from Interaxis addresses the different investment questions he receives in Ask an Expert.Happy reading.– S.M.You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.The Investment Case for Bitcoin is Strong and Getting Stronger, but so is the Case for EthereumBitcoin sailed past $70,000 this week, hitting new all-time highs, driven by the massive (and seemingly insatiable) investor interest in the new U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs, which by all accounts have had one of the best launches in history. They’ve amassed more than $10 billion of net inflows in less than two months. By comparison, it took Gold ETFs two years and S&P 500 ETFs three years to hit the same mark.With demand in overdrive, we stand on the brink of another supply shock, with the Bitcoin halving less than two months away. Every four years the amount of new bitcoin that gets periodically created by the network to pay miners for securing the Bitcoin blockchain gets halved. A new bitcoin all-time high has followed each prior halving.So, with the dual tailwind of Bitcoin ETF flows and the upcoming halving, is Bitcoin the best bet? Not so fast. Ethereum, the next biggest crypto asset by market cap, has a case of its own to make. Whereas bitcoin is often described as a store of value, medium of exchange, or both – essentially cash for the internet – Ethereum is a platform for developers building over 4,500 applications in areas as diverse as art and collectibles (NFTs), stocks, bonds, and real estate (real-world assets or RWAs), fiat currencies (stablecoins) and internet-native organizations called DAOs, known collectively as Web3.Wall Street is getting wise to Ethereum’s potential: just last week, Bernstein released a research report that forecasted a big comeback for DeFi, saying that they ""expect a big bang DeFi recovery and the investor narrative to come back as the future of blockchain finance."" As I write in my new book, Web3: Charting the Internet's Next Economic and Cultural Frontier, the adoption of Web3 is growing in stature among enterprises as well, with 52% of Fortune 100 companies having launched blockchain-related projects since 2020.What’s more, three catalysts could propel ETH to all-time highs and help it to outpace bitcoin:First, since September 2022, Ethereum’s supply has decreased by a total of 430,000 ETH, which is equivalent to $1.7 billion at today’s value. In that timeframe, Bitcoin’s supply has increased by 490,000 BTC ($35 billion). Why the difference in trajectories? Because a portion of fees paid by users for using Ethereum goes towards retiring or ""burning"" tokens, akin to a share buyback in traditional public markets. The more active the network the higher the burn and the greater the deflation, and network activity has been heating up recently.Exhibit A: Ethereum versus Bitcoin Net Supply Change Since the MergeSecond, this week, Ethereum underwent a major network upgrade that can help address its scalability concerns. One of the knocks against Ethereum is that the network is expensive to use, opening the door to competitors like Solana. This upgrade should help optimize its scalability potential and maximize its capacity. Higher throughput and lower fees will help Ethereum build a greater lead over competitors.Finally, we may see an ETH ETF as early as May this year. May 23 is the final deadline for the SEC to decide on the VanEck and ARK 21Shares applications. As a sign of growing confidence in an ETF approval, Grayscale's closed-end Ethereum Trust (ETHE) with $11.6 billion in assets is currently trading at an 8.17% discount. This time last year, ETHE was trading at a 59% discount to NAV. Senior Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart put the odds of a May 23 approval at only 35% but in my view, the market is giving the ETF little odds of approval by May. On a recent episode of my podcast DeFi Decoded, Seyffart said that even if the May deadline fails to yield approval, an ETH ETF is still a matter of when not if.Conclusion:ETH and BTC have been the leaders for years. During past cycles, ETH has strengthened against bitcoin, hitting highs of 0.15 and 0.09 ETH per BTC in 2017 and 2021, respectively. The current ratio of 0.056 is only slightly above its 3-year low. Assuming a hypothetical target of $100,000 for bitcoin, Ethereum would hit $14,750 using the 2017 metric high and $8,800 using 2021’s high.Exhibit B: ETH/BTC Ratio Since Ethereum InceptionBetween bitcoin and ether, I don’t believe there is a bad option if you’re looking to gain exposure to the leading platforms and assets of Web3. But, with sound fundamentals and several upcoming catalysts, I believe Ethereum has the edge.- Alex Tapscott, managing director of the Ninepoint Digital Asset GroupAsk an Expert:Q. We’ve heard there is a fixed supply of bitcoin. Is there also a fixed supply of ETH?A: There is no fixed ETH supply, like with Bitcoin (21 million). Ether has a different issuance policy.Just like with Bitcoin, new ETH is created with each new block (about every 12-13 seconds), and used as a reward for those who are processing transactions. However, this doesn’t mean the supply of ETH is infinite.With each processed block, some ETH is also burned or taken out of existence forever. The amount burned is based on the number of transactions in that block. So, if there are more transactions, we often burn more ETH with each block than the new ETH created. This leads to a deflationary policy—we are currently seeing about 1.3% less ETH per year.In summary: As the Ethereum network is adopted and used more, there should be fewer ETH available in the world.Q. Is the investment thesis for ETH the same as for BTC?A: We just discussed the issuance policy for ETH and how it differs from bitcoin.Now to talk about why someone would invest in ETH or BTC, and how they’re different.Most of the investment theses for bitcoin revolve around the verifiably scarce supply and bitcoin as a store-of-value and hedge against inflation. As more dollars, euros and yen are created, and bitcoin supply is very slowly moving up at a known rate, the value of the bitcoin relative to dollars should increase.For ETH the demand generation is different. ETH is used to pay for transactions on the Ethereum network, or as we commonly refer to it, to pay for blockspace.So, as we see more adoption of the Ethereum network – stablecoin usage, NFTs, tokenized assets – there will be a requisite demand for ETH to move those transactions forward.With the issuance policy described above – more ETH being burned than created in each block – an increase in demand should raise the value.Of course, ETH also comes with staking ability – the chance to lock up some of my ETH to receive rewards similar to a stock dividend. We see demand for ETH not just to pay for transactions but to stake and earn rewards as income.If you do your research and determine that the adoption of the Ethereum network will increase, it makes sense to think that the value of ETH will increase, as will the price at which we bid up the price to use it to pay for transactions.-  Adam Blumberg, InteraxisKeep ReadingBitcoin’s market cap surpassed the silver this week after reaching a new all-time high.Did the White House predict bitcoin’s price to reach $250,000 by 2035?Spot Bitcoin ETFs now hold $55 billion AUM two months post-launch.Edited by Bradley Keoun.Learn more about Consensus 2024, CoinDesk's longest-running and most influential event that brings together all sides of crypto, blockchain and Web3.

The average fee on Coinbase’s layer 2 solution Base fell to 3 cents from roughly $1.50, while Arbitrum’s declined to 40 cents. The average fee on zkSync and Zora also fell.Dencun upgrade introduced Binary Large Objects (blobs), which attach large data chunks to regular transactions. Blobs store data off-chain and become inaccessible after three weeks, unlike call data, which is stored permanently.As such, layer 2 rollups like Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync can now store data in blobs instead of expensive call data, processing transactions at a lower cost. Rollups compute transactions outside the Ethereum main chain and then bundle multiple transactions into a single transaction before submission to the main chain.Average transaction costs on layer 2 solutions. (Marcov/Dune) (Marcov/Dune)Note that rollups need to implement blobs manually. So far, Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, Zora, and zkSync have done so, per Marcov. According to data tracking website L2Beat, there are more than 40 rollups on Ethereum, of which 26 are upcoming projects.The consensus is that the blob mechanism will eventually lead to a 90% slide in transaction costs on layer 2 solutions. Per Vitalik Buterin, 125 kb of call data costs approximately 0.06 ETH ($238). Meanwhile, a similar-sized blob is likely to cost 0.001 ETH ($3.98), according to decentralized prediction platform Polymarket.That said, the Dencun upgrade is yet to boost investor interest in the native tokens of rollups, which supposedly stand to benefit the most from the blob-carrying transactions.As of writing, Optimism’s OP token traded 4.6% lower at $4.30, and Arbitrum’s ARB token changed hands at $2.07, down 6% on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk data.Edited by Parikshit Mishra.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

It provides a cheap and temporary way to store data, lowering fees for layer 2 networks like Optimism and Base blockchain.Ethereum developers are having some fun on the blockchain as a drop in data fees on the Ethereum network after the Dencun upgrade.Developers are posting the entire script of the Bee Movie, an animated comedy by legendary comedian Jerry Seinfeld about a bee who sues humans, on the Ethereum blockchain for cheap following the Dencun upgrade.“I didn’t get the first blob, but as far as I can tell, I DID get the first BEE MOVIE on mainnet,” posted Paradigm developer Dan Cline on Wednesday, shortly after the new blobs feature went live. The transaction cost only about $14.Shortly afterward, another developer posted the script for just $5 as fees fell further. Copying and pasting the Bee Movie script is a niche internet meme that originated on Tumblr and quickly spread to Reddit, YouTube, Facebook, and other social media platforms.In March 2023, a developer posted the script on the Bitcoin blockchain for the first time after Ordinals technology, a way to post text data on Bitcoin, went live.Blobs are a cheap way to temporarily carry data about transactions that are now possible after Wednesday’s upgrade. Uploaded data exists on the network for about eighteen days, after which it is permanently removed.These blobs are designed primarily for layer 2 networks that run atop Ethereum as an alternative to data storage within Ethereum blocks.And it’s working well so far. Data from L2Fees shows that fees on layer 2 network Optimism were less than a cent as of Thursday morning, much lower than their usual levels. Elsewhere, Base blockchain developers are reporting a 99.8% drop—with fees at $0.0005 instead of $0.31.Edited by Parikshit Mishra.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The bank said it disagreed.“Private investors and individuals have propagated both gold and bitcoin year-to-date rather than shifting from the former to the latter,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.“Beyond retail investors, speculative institutional investors such as hedge funds including momentum traders such as CTAs appear to have also propagated the rally by buying both gold and bitcoin futures since February, perhaps more heavily than retail investors,” the authors wrote.The bank’s analysis shows a “sharp position build-up since February of $7b in bitcoin futures and $30b in gold futures.”The risk of mean reversion looks high, the bank said, which means both assets could fall back toward their average levels.Software developer MicroStrategy (MSTR), which has a corporate strategy of buying bitcoin, also played a part in amplifying the rally, the bank said. The company has bought over $1 billion of bitcoin this year, adding to the more than $1 billion acquired in the last quarter of 2023, the report noted.“We believe the debt-funded bitcoin purchases by MicroStrategy add leverage and froth to the current crypto rally and raise the risk of more severe deleveraging in a potential downturn in the future,” the report said.Read more: Bitcoin Is Unlikely to Match Gold’s Allocation in Investors’ Portfolios in Nominal Terms: JPMorganEdited by Sheldon Reback.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

It allows users to create their own layer 2 networks and drives the value of its native BVM tokens.Developers told CoinDesk that the team plans ""juicy"" airdrops for BVM stakers, which could fuel demand for the tokens.Bitcoin Virtual Machine, a protocol founded late February, is gaining traction among traders betting on the general growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem, driving demand for its BVM tokens.Data shows that the project’s BVM tokens have added 35% in the past 24 hours, beating a general market decline. The CoinDesk 20 Index fell 5.3% in the same period. The tokens have surged to $3.5 from an intitial of 20 cents on March 8.The project lets users spin up their own layer-2 networks on the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin and Ethereum are known as layer-1 protocols, and attempts to scale and expand them are layer 2s. While the Ethereum ecosystem has had multiple layer 2 projects aimed at providing faster, cheaper transactions for years, the Bitcoin version really kicked off only in 2023 following the introduction of Ordinals technology.The value propositions for the token are driven by staking rewards for BVM holders and a cut of fees generated by the service, developer @punk3700 told CoinDesk in a direct message interview on X.“We have 40%-50% circulating staked by our holders. Working on a few airdrop deals for BVM stakers,” @punk3700 said. “Some of them could be quite juicy.”On Friday, the team said Naka Chain, a Bitcoin layer-2 build on BVM, will airdrop 10.5 million tokens to BVM token stakers. The airdrop is proportional to a user’s staked holdings and will be locked for three months.Tokens based on the Bitcoin blockchain first started to emerge as an investment thesis in mid-2023, led by Ordinals technology and BRC-20 tokens.The BRC-20 standard (BRC stands for Bitcoin Request for Comment) was introduced in April and allowed users to issue transferable tokens directly through the network for the first time. The tokens, called inscriptions, function on the Ordinals Protocol. That protocol allows users to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small bitcoin-based transactions.@punk3700 previously told CoinDesk that bitcoin’s usage in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications has so far been limited to tokenized representations of bitcoin on other chains, such as Ethereum or Solana, but that there’s a gap for wealthy bitcoin holders to use their assets on native applications, fueling the investment thesis.The BRC-20 tokens have a cumulative $3.5 billion market capitalization as of Friday, CoinGecko data shows.Edited by Sheldon Reback.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The mem coins jumped as much as 60% after Avalanche’s disclosure, beating a general market-wide drop.DEXTools data further shows a bump in trading volumes on Avalanche tokens alongside a rise in the issuance of new meme tokens, likely in hopes of a new cult becoming the next Foundation pick.Following the disclosure, volumes on the Avalanche exchange Trader Joe grew to $65 million on Thursday from $53 million on Wednesday, although these volumes include all tokens.Avalanche referred to these meme tokens as community coins. “Community coins have become vital Web3 touchstones today. They represent the fun, spirit, uniqueness, and interests of diverse crypto communities,” it stated.COQ was among Avalanche’s runaway meme hits in December amid a meme coin frenzy. A single trader acquired just over $450 worth of COQ shortly after its issuance and managed to turn it into over $2.5 million in a few weeks, with thousands of hopeful memes deployed on the network later on to emulate COQ’s apparent success.Meme coins are often considered a scammy part of the market among blockchain purists, but the success of this niche—led by investments from prominent blockchain teams—could be starting to change the stigma associated with investing in such tokens.Edited by Parikshit Mishra.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Since early March, traders have been using such tokens to bet on the victory of the next president, as CoinDesk reported.Meanwhile, some investment managers pointed out the meme coin mania was likely to keep going as users were able to gamble small amounts of capital for cheap – in hopes of a substantially large profit.“This mania is likely going to last longer than most people think,” Tushar Jain, co-founder of Multicoin Capital, said on X. “Past meme coin manias died because of Ethereum’s fees. It doesn’t make sense to punt around $100s when fees are also $100s.""“I expect Solana meme coin mania to last much longer due to low fees,” Jain added. Solana’s ecosystem has seen a meme coin frenzy since December, following rapid rises and success stories in WIF and BONK.Still, the sector remains volatile and ripe for scams. DEXTools data shows that hundreds of meme tokens, with themes ranging from frogs to Spider-Man, were issued by opportunistic developers in the past 24 hours.Most have dropped 100% after a few hours of going live, possibly representing thousands of dollars in losses for hopeful investors.Edited by Parikshit Mishra.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The largest cryptocurrency is currently trading around $73,000.Schiff had predicted bitcoin’s decline in a 2014 interview with CoinDesk and likened it to “tulip mania 2.0” in a 2013 CNBC interview. He hasn't changed his stance since, but wouldn’t have shied away from investing given the potential for profit.“Do I wish I had made the decision to have thrown $10,000, $50,000, $100,000 into it?” Schiff said on an Impact Theory podcast on Wednesday in a debate with crypto investor Raoul Pal, discussing if bitcoin was going to $1 million or zero. “Sure. I may be worth hundreds of millions assuming I didn’t sell. But again, I don’t know what I would have done had I made that decision.”Bitcoin has surged over 200% in the past year on multiple catalysts, such as growth in underlying technology and demand from spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offered in the U.S. Gold has risen 13% over the past year, data shows, with an estimated market capitalization of $14 trillion.“I would have bought it just betting on other people being dumb enough to buy it and pay a higher price,” he said, likening a successful bitcoin investment to a gamble rather than a “genius” move.Edited by Sheldon Reback.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

(Mae Mu/Unsplash)10 Years of Decentralizing the FutureMay 29-31, 2024 - Austin, TexasThe biggest and most established global hub for everything crypto, blockchain and Web3.Register NowShare on FacebookShare on LinkedInShare on XPancakeSwap's version 4 will be released later this year with four key features: hooks, custom pool types, singleton and flash accounting, aiming to make on-chain trading cheaper and more efficient for users.The new version will be available on the Ethereum and BNB Chain networks in the third quarter, offering improved pricing of listed assets, reduced gas consumption and lower deployment costs.Decentralized exchange (DEX) PancakeSwap will release version 4 (v4) later this year, adding four features to its automated market maker (AMM) to make on-chain trading cheaper and more efficient for users, developers told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat today.“PancakeSwap v4 code will be released under an open-source license,” head developer Chef Mochi said. “It addresses the shortcomings of current AMMs, including inflexibility in pricing models for all assets, lack of CEX-level execution functions, impermanent loss for liquidity providers, and pricey on-chain gas fees for users.”A CEX is a centralized exchange such as Coinbase (COIN) or Binance.The four new features are:Hooks, or externally deployed contracts, that let developers add customizable add-ons. The add-ons allow for changing the type of fees charged for a trade and the type of trading order (such as limit or market orders). Hook creators can either keep fees for themselves or distribute them to stakeholders.Custom pool types offer several types of liquidity pools to users and aim to provide better pricing of listed assets. That would help prevent a token’s price from fluctuating wildly during times of demand or selling, ensuring it is more appropriately priced at times of market stress.Singleton merges all pools into a single contract to reduce the deployment cost by 99%. The gas cost, or the fee paid for each blockchain transfer, is further reduced for swaps because there is no need to transfer tokens between separate contracts.Flash accounting, which also reduces gas consumption, settles a bunch of transactions collectively. Gas fees tend to surge during times of market volatility, becoming expensive in a way that could limit a user’s ability to conduct a trade.V4 will initially be available on the Ethereum and BNB Chain networks in the third quarter. The DEX holds $2.4 billion worth of tokens locked in liquidity pools and other services and processed $1.7 billion in trading volumes in the past 24 hours, DefiLlama data shows.Edited by Sheldon Reback.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Total inflows crossed the $4 billion mark.Some traders said that the bitcoin price action suggested institutional buying.“The intraday nature of the move is reminiscent of the behavior of large institutional traders, with trading algorithms intercepting the move and retail traders often joining in,” Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email to CoinDesk. “Either way, the overall trend remains bullish, and bitcoin is back towards its highs as we head into early European trading.”General market sentiment remains bullish among professional investors, as reported, with some expecting the market to run into a “sell-side crisis” later this year as buying demand from ETF continues to increase.Edited by Sheldon Reback.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

These projects claim to utilize AI in various ways, such as providing a virtual companion and being a marketplace for graphic processing cards.Behind the surge are reports that crypto AI project developers are attending the chipmaker's conference or taking part in panels, according to Lookonchain. The event will be held from March 17-21. The advance compares with bitcoin’s 0.3% increase and a 0.4% gain in the CoinDesk 20, a broad-based liquid index of major tokens.AI tokens remain a hot narrative for crypto traders because the technology is expected to drive key innovations in the global economy in the coming years. However, the relationship between AI and crypto is unclear: Artifical intelligence cannot run on a blockchain. Even so, developments in traditional AI companies, such as OpenAI, drive gains in AI tokens as traders utilize them as a proxy bet on the industry.The tokens also rallied last month after Nvidia beat fourth-quarter earnings and first-quarter guidance expectations.Meanwhile, the inflows into AI tokens seem to have put the brakes on a multiweek rally for meme coins, data shows.Tokens such as dogecoin (DOGE), pepecoin (PEPE) and dogwifhat (WIF) have more than doubled over the past few weeks as bitcoin briefly broke its all-time highs. Some observers attributed the surge to meme coins being more friendly to retail traders, who are typically driven to crypto markets during bitcoin rallies.The rally seems to be done for now. DOGE, SHIB and PEPE lost over 15% in the past 24 hours, data shows. And in another sign of money leaving the market, open interest on DOGE-tracked futures has dropped $400 million from record highs since Tuesday.Edited by Sheldon Reback.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Bitcoin is currently trading at a 10% premium in South Korea.The arbitrage popularized by Sam Bankman-Fried involves buying bitcoin on a global exchange and selling it on a Korean exchange for a riskless profit in Korean won.Pocketing the actual gains is difficult due to South Korea's strict capital controls.A profitable yet operationally difficult arbitrage trade is back in vogue as bitcoin prices now command an average 10% premium in South Korea.As of Asian morning hours, bitcoin trades just above $66,000 on most global exchanges. It commands over 93 million won on Korean exchanges such as Upbit, worth over $71,000 at current exchange rates.The phenomenon is the so-called “Kimchi premium,” named after a popular Korean dish of fermented cabbage, which refers to the difference in bitcoin prices on local Korean exchanges compared to global bourses.The trade is simple in theory: One can buy bitcoin on a global exchange, transfer it to a Korean exchange, and sell it for a 10% riskless profit in Korean won.But pocketing gains from the arbitrage is quite difficult. Korea has strict capital controls, and it is challenging for foreigners to withdraw large amounts of money from the country. It means big funds cannot capitalize on the trade, and smaller investors may not have the required infrastructure.An infamous example of someone who took advantage of the Kimchi premium was Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the now-bankrupt trading firm Alameda Research and FTX exchange. Bankman-Fried has claimed in several interviews that the premium was as high as 50% during 2019 and 2020, which allowed his firm to make as much as a million dollars a day, per CNBC.Meanwhile, some observers say the premium is a sign of retail participation and arises due to substantial local demand for the asset.“Korean retail investors are getting back,” Ki Young Ju, founder of on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant, said in an X post. “Korea Premium Index(a.k.a. Kimchi Premium) is a pure retail FOMO indicator.”CryptoQuant’s head of research Bradley Park told CoinDesk in a Telegram message that some traders were likely taking advantage of the trade.“As the kimchi premium increases, traders will take advantage of the arb opportunity and bring their overseas holdings home, which means Upbit's Bitcoin reserves will increase,” Park said. “We have observed a significant increase (in these reserves) at the end of February.”Bitcoin prices are unchanged in the past 24 hours.

The category rose 2.8% on average, with lower caps like myro (MYRO) and mog coin (MOG) rising as much as 80%.WIF was issued in November 2023 and quickly went viral in crypto circles. Much of the token’s memetic value is derived from its connection to an image of a dog wearing a hat – and the “wif hat” usage that has caught on and grown among crypto circles.WIF traded nearly $1 billion in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows. It is the first major meme token with a price of over $1. Meme tokens usually tend to have a significantly large circulating supply – and prices of any major meme, such as dogecoin (DOGE) or shiba inu {{SHIB}], have never crossed the psychologically large $1 mark.A listing on the prominent exchange Binance likely drove such price action, with the exchange recording $219 million in WIF trades within its first day.Anticipation of future exchange listings and popularity among retail audiences contributed to gains, as per some X posts.Meme coins have been in focus since late February amid a bitcoin-led rally. Investors have been treating these tokens as a bet on the growth of their underlying networks, as previously reported.UPDATE (March 6, 12:03 UTC): Rewrites headline to add record high.Edited by Parikshit Mishra.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

It dropped to as low as $60,800 but neared $67,000 in Asian morning hours – indicating resilience.Some observers said the selling pressure was likely driven by profit-taking at historical highs and miners offloading some of their bitcoin holdings.

46,Why William Hinman`s Emails Matter to the XRP Army and the Crypto’s Price,https://www.coindesk.com/learn/why-william-hinmans-emails-matter-to-the-xrp-army-and-the-cryptos-price/,"LearnWhy William Hinman`s Emails Matter to the XRP Army and the Crypto’s PriceWhy William Hinman`s Emails Matter to the XRP Army and the Crypto’s Price(Ripple Labs)Why William Hinman`s Emails Matter to the XRP Army and the Crypto’s PriceRecently released emails from former SEC director William Hinman have rallied the XRP troops, but the documents are not a smoking gun. By David Z. MorrisUpdated Mar 8, 2024 at 4:59 p.m. UTCShare on FacebookShare on LinkedInShare on XBeginnerOn June 13, 2023, documents tied to William Hinman, the former director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s Division of Corporation Finance from 2017 to 2020, were released to the public in connection with the SEC's lawsuit against Ripple, briefly sending the price of the XRP token up 7.4% as optimism spread that Ripple would win their ongoing case.Here’s why:Very broadly, Ripple and its partisans have argued that the Hinman emails could reveal a biased or flawed process behind the decision to publicly suggest in a 2018 speech by Hinman that Ethereum (ETH) may not be a security. One smoking gun might have been some sort of display of bias against Ripple and XRP, but the released emails do not mention either directly.Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty argued after the release that the emails showed Hinman ignoring warnings from colleagues that his speech was not grounded in law and created confusion about securities designations. At the very least, Alderoy seems to be suggesting Ripple has been treated unfairly by regulators.Early analysis of the emails does not seem to have found a major win for Ripple Labs, however. After a short rally on the morning of the emails’ release, XRP retraced its price and headed even lower, which may reflect some disappointment on this front.Ahead of the documents’ release, Ripple and XRP supporters had been focused on statements by Hinman suggesting that a token isn’t a security if it is “sufficiently decentralized.” That metric seems to have been used to justify a public carveout for Ethereum, but, at least according to feedback given to Hinman by other SEC staff and officials, was not grounded in existing securities regulation. Ripple has argued that XRP, like Ethereum, is “sufficiently decentralized” and should not be classified as a security according to the standards laid out by Hinman.Critics have long argued, however, that the underlying claim that Ethereum and XRP are comparably decentralized is itself highly debatable. Most significantly, there has now been close to a decade of debate and litigation over whether Ripple itself should be considered the creator of the XRP ledger and issuer of the XRP token – and therefore the issuer and seller of an unregistered security.Ripple Labs allies generally characterize the company as separate from XRP. In particular, they have argued that the XRP blockchain was created by Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen, working as OpenCoin, before an entity called “Ripple” even existed. But OpenCoin became Ripple Labs and what is today simply called Ripple, and those cofounders “gifted” 80 billion XRP, 80% of the total supply, to Ripple Labs. Over the years, Ripple has made a variety of branding and messaging changes to represent that they are not the creators of XRP. That includes changing the preferred way to discuss the token itself, which for many years was commonly referred to as “Ripple.”Read More: What Is Ripple and the XRP Cryptocurrency?To critics such as Preston Byrne, this looks like an orchestrated deception, and one of the earliest instances of “decentralization theater.” And if XRP was effectively created or issued by Ripple, the parallel to Ethereum breaks down quickly, since Ethereum has no corporate for-profit parent. This could be a more compelling explanation for the different regulatory treatment of the two chains than bias or procedural failures.In any case, however the case develops and is ultimately decided, whenever new information is released that supporters believe bolsters or hurts Ripple's side of the case, XRP's price generally moves in parallel with the positive or negative sentiment.See Also: Ripple Does Not Care Whether XRP Is “Sufficiently Decentralized”Edited by Toby Leah Bochan.This article was originally published on Jun 14, 2023 at 4:49 p.m. UTCDisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

47,Binance Crypto Exchange: Your Questions Answered,https://www.coindesk.com/learn/binance-crypto-exchange-your-questions-answered/,"LearnBinance Crypto Exchange: Your Questions AnsweredBinance Crypto Exchange: Your Questions AnsweredChangpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance (Casper Labs)Binance Crypto Exchange: Your Questions AnsweredFollowing the SEC charges against the world’s largest crypto exchange, people are wondering what’s the difference between Binance and Binance.us, who is Changpeng Zhao and more. By Toby BochanUpdated Sep 29, 2023 at 12:03 p.m. UTCShare on FacebookShare on LinkedInShare on XBeginnerFounded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao, who is often referred to as just “CZ,” Binance is the world's leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume as of June 2023. The company was originally based in China but had to leave Shanghai due to regulatory restrictions shortly after its launch.Binance developed its own blockchain, Binance Smart Chain (later renamed to BNB Chain), which facilitates trades on the exchange. The native token of the blockchain is Binance coin (BNB) and the company has also launched a stablecoin, BinanceUSD (BUSD). Because of U.S. regulatory rules, Binance created a supposedly separate company for its U.S. clients in 2019, Binance.US.On June 5, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against Binance.US as well as CZ, who serves as Binance CEO, on allegations of violating federal securities laws by offering BNB and BUSD to the general public, calling them unregistered securities. The SEC lawsuit also casts fresh doubt on the independence of the company’s U.S. arm and its staking service.Read more about the SEC suit hereThis is not Binance’s first battle with U.S. regulators. Binance is also under ongoing scrutiny from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) who sued CZ and Binance in March 2023, alleging the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S.Here is everything you need to know about Binance, Binance.US and CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao.Who is Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao and why did he launch Binance?CZ is a well-known personality in crypto, actively engaging with the crypto community through Twitter and speaking at conferences and to the media. As for his origins, he was born in China and emigrated to Canada when he was 12 and says he is a Canadian citizen. In high school, he worked part-time at McDonald’s, which is part of his well-known lore. He graduated from McGill University with a degree in Computer Science.After college, he worked for the Tokyo stock exchange and Bloomberg Tradebook developing software for the businesses. He then founded a startup in 2005, Fusion Systems, which focused on creating an automated high-frequency trading platform. Following that, he worked for several crypto startups including a stint as co-founder and CTO of OKCoin. Another piece of the CZ lore is that he first heard about Bitcoin at a poker game, which planted the seed that led him to create his own cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.According to the white paper, Zhao's goal for Binance was to compete with other exchanges by offering solutions to the numerous problems he saw with the cryptocurrency trading infrastructure – including poor technical architecture, insecure platforms, low market liquidity, poor customer support and poor language support.Shortly after Binance’s 2017 launch, Binance raised $15 million through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for BNB, the terms of which were also laid out in the white paper.What’s the difference between Binance and Binance.US?Binance started as one big company, founded in Shanghai in 2017. Because of China’s crackdown on crypto, the company left shortly after and while there were efforts to relocate the headquarters to Singapore and Malta was once thought to be Binance’s base, CZ currently claims that Binance has no headquarters and that wherever he is, that is where Binance is based.Binance also has a native coin, Binance Coin (BNB), which was initially launched on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token and subsequently migrated to Binance's proprietary blockchain, BNB Chain. BNB functions as an exchange token, meaning holders of BNB with Binance accounts can access discounted fees on the exchange.Binance created Binance.US in 2019 in response to regulatory requirements in the United States and notified customers that their accounts would be required to migrate to the new U.S-based exchange in November 2020. That said, many people noted that by using a VPN service, U.S.-based customers could still use Binance’s services.One of the biggest differences between the two exchanges is that Binance.com offers a much wider range of cryptocurrencies, with over 500 available for trading. Binance.US offers over 120 cryptocurrencies and is not available in all states as of writing, with Hawaii, New York, Texas, and Vermont blocking use of the exchange.The other big difference is that Binance.US does not offer margin trading or futures contracts, while Binance does. Both platforms offer low fees.Finally, unlike Binance’s stance that it has no headquarters, the U.S. arm is clearly based in Palo Alto, California. The SEC suit is specifically against Binance.US and Zhao and not the larger exchange.Binance: A timeline of major events and notable newsJuly 2017: Binance launches and raises $15 million through its BNB ICO.July 2018: Binance acquires Trust Wallet, a free, non-custodial mobile wallet to support its upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) offering.January 2019: Binance starts to offer support for new token listings through ICOs (initial coin offerings) and IEOs (initial exchange offerings), through its Launchpad product.April 2019: Binance migrates BNB from Ethereum to its proprietary chain, then called Binance Smart Chain (now rebranded to Binance chain or BNB chain)April 2019: Binance launches its DEX ahead of schedule.May 2019: Binance gets hacked for the first time.

Voyager, had gone into bankruptcy earlier in 2022 and originally had agreed to sell its assets to FTX, which folded itself.February 2023: BUSD issuer Paxos is hit with a one-two punch of an investigation by the New York Department of Financial Services and a Wells Notice from the SEC, which some believed hinted at Binance as a future target for the SEC. Following these actions, Paxos halted minting BUSD.March 2023: The CFTC sues CZ and Binance over allegations that the company offered unregistered crypto derivatives products.April 2023: Rumors of an Interpol “Red Notice” for CZ tank BNB price, but there is little to back up the claim.April 2023: Binance.US pulls out of a $1 billion deal to buy Voyager Digital’s assets, attributing the termination to the ""hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States.""June 2023: The SEC files charges against Binance.US and its founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao on allegations of violating federal securities laws with BNB token and Binance-linked BUSD stablecoin.

50,What Is 'Web5' and How Is it Different From Web3?,https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-web5-and-how-is-it-different-from-web3/,"LearnWhat Is 'Web5' and How Is it Different From Web3?What Is 'Web5' and How Is it Different From Web3?Screenshot of TBD Web5 Presentation (tbd.website)What Is 'Web5' and How Is it Different From Web3?There are a few things that make Jack Dorsey’s vision for Web5 distinct, including not wanting to completely replace Web2 but work with it.By Robert StevensUpdated Dec 20, 2022 at 8:51 p.m. UTCShare on FacebookShare on LinkedInShare on XBeginnerThe world is still getting its collective head around Web3 – a suite of decentralized protocols that add a (disputably) censorship-resistant financial layer to the internet. So why did Jack Dorsey, the creator of Web2 platform Twitter, skip right ahead to what he calls ""Web5""?It turns out that, despite the name, Web5 does not follow the yet-to-be-created Web4. The Web5 platform, announced in June, 2022 by TBD, the crypto and decentralized finance arm of Dorsey’s payments company, Block (née Square), is firmly based on Web3 tech, but promises “an extra decentralized web platform.”To land on the name Web5, TBD just added Web3 (an internet powered by blockchain-based smart contracts) to Web2 (centralized content platforms, like Twitter or Facebook). Put simply: 3 + 2 = 5.Web5 presentation (tbd.website)Web5’s core idea is to “put you in control of your data and identity” – a core tenet of Web3’s decentralized identity systems. Instead of inviting users to sign up for an account on a centralized platform (like an Instagram account), Web3 protocols reference users by their crypto wallet addresses. Protocols like the Ethereum Name Service let users turn their wallet’s garbled alphanumeric string into a word or phrase (like jane.eth) similar to how Domain Name Service (DNS) allowed websites to have addresses like coindesk.com rather than a long string of numbers like 54.235.191.121. Decentralized data storage is a concept already in existence and is provided by platforms like Filecoin and IPFS.Dorsey’s Web5 offers similar capabilities. Instead of an internet that relies on accounts provided by companies that hold customer data “captive in app silos,” Web5 pushes for “a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center.”There are three pillars at Web5’s core: self-owned decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials and decentralized web nodes for storing data and relaying messages. It sounds a lot like what decentralized identity services have been doing since the Ethereum Name Service launched in May 2017.The pillars of Web5  (tbd.website)So, what’s new here – apart from yet another stab at decentralized identities? Part of the answer may lie in Dorsey’s allegiance to bitcoin and his aggressive dismissal of Web3 culture. For Dorsey, bitcoin, launched in a truly decentralized fashion in 2009, is the only cryptocurrency that matters, the rest having been corrupted by venture capitalists who bent the platforms to their will. Accordingly, Web5 is run without any “special utility tokens or subjective consensus” that is part of the governance-token, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-controlled protocols like the Ethereum Name Service.In doing so, Web5 sounds like an attempt to rid Web3 of the centralized actors that Dorsey credits with sullying the mission of decentralization. Zion, a self-described Web5 app, uses Bitcoin’s base layer to help content creators work together with fans. But avoiding corruption is, of course, difficult: Web5’s nascent community already balked at TBD’s attempt to trademark the term Web5.The other thing that is different from Web3 is that Web5 works with existing Web2 services; it does not seek to replace them entirely. Web5’s pitch deck provides the example of Groove adding a playlist to a Web5 user’s decentralized identifier, which another music service, Tidal, can use to fashion its own playlists within the app. The decentralized identifier prevents the user from having to recreate their preferences on another platform.TBD’s other example of Web5 in action involves one user granting her hotel, airline and rental car provider the ability to add information to her database about her trip. The user can revoke access at any time and choose another service to “help her visualize her itinerary.” Again, the idea is to tie data that’s usually locked inside centralized services – something TBD calls “a massive, unworkable mess” – to a single user-controlled identity. Think of it as similar to how many sites and apps leverage a user’s Google account to log in, but in this case it will be a single login with a decentralized network of nodes.Will it work? Time will tell. So far, the only decentralized identity service that’s caught on in any measure is the Ethereum Name Service, and the only data storage system with any cachet is the interplanetary file service (better known as IPFS).One of the key things that distinguish TBD’s ambition is the backing of its billionaire progenitor, Jack Dorsey. But it’s unclear how Web5 would make money or why, ideological reasons aside, the company is creating such a service. Strategy consultant Adrien Book laid out the problem pretty well in a Medium post that followed Web5’s announcement: “Jack seems to want to keep the taste of Web3 without the calories. It’s like a high school student saying ‘yeah, but communism has never been REALLY tried as it’s meant to be.’ It’s naive.”This article was originally published on Dec 20, 2022 at 8:40 p.m. UTCDisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

CoinDesk’s Social Token, ExplainedDESK is not a currency. It is not for speculation and will not make anyone rich. (Sergej Vasylchenko/Getty Images)What Is DESK? CoinDesk’s Social Token, ExplainedHow to earn, store and spend our blockchain-powered answer to loyalty points. By CoinDesk StaffUpdated Mar 16, 2023 at 5:39 p.m. UTCShare on FacebookShare on LinkedInShare on XBeginnerAt CoinDesk, we’re not just chronicling the business model transformation that digital assets and the blockchain have made possible – we’re actively participating in it.At Consensus 2021, a virtual event, we beta-tested DESK, an experiment in using tokenized rewards to incentivize engagement and community-building, garnering positive feedback from our audience. At Consensus 2022, CoinDesk relaunched DESK as a full-fledged on-chain social token, making it a core part of the experience at our first live event since 2019.In December 2022, CoinDesk expanded the functionality of DESK to integrate the token into the broader user experience. Now, readers can earn DESK by reading articles, watching videos and more on CoinDesk.com.Read More: DESK Upgrade on CoinDesk’s Website Offers Tokenized Reader ExperienceBelow is everything you need to know about DESK and how to use it. This post will be updated regularly as we build out the DESK program, so check back every so often for the latest information.DESK FAQ:What is DESK?DESK is CoinDesk’s social token.What is DESK’s mission?DESK is designed to build a community around the CoinDesk brand and to reward our audience for engaging with our content.DESK’s ethos is modeled on the founding principles of blockchain technology: openness, community, empowerment and innovation. We hope to use DESK to create a feedback loop with our users to help us build out an ecosystem together.How can I get DESK?As of this update, you can start earning DESK by creating an account at coindesk.com and engaging with our content, such as reading Consensus Magazine articles. Other ways to earn DESK include:Listening to episodes of Carpe ConsensusWatching select CDTV episodesVisiting the DESK HubEngaging in chats on our Discord serverAt Consensus 2023, we'll have many in-person ways to earn DESK, such as 2022's Easter egg airdrops around the festival. Stay tuned!Cool, so what can I do with DESK?Unlock the token-gated Discord serverUsers with at least 1 DESK can vote for our special community polls and earn DESK for engaging.You can tip other users with DESKAt Consensus 2022, attendees were able to redeem DESK for such rewards as:A drink at the barFood from nearby vendors that have partnered with CoinDeskMerchandise, such as hoodies or T-shirtsNon-fungible tokens (NFT) from our online marketplaceSpecial on-site offers from Consensus exhibitors and partnersUnique experiences, like playing ""Horse"" basketball with Spencer Dinwiddie or chess with Garry Kasparov.On what blockchain is DESK?DESK runs on Polygon, a sidechain, or parallel network, to Ethereum.Why isn’t DESK on Ethereum proper?Polygon helps us provide a gasless experience because of the lower costs per transaction.What do I need to do before the next Consensus to be able to spend DESK?You’ll need to set up a cryptocurrency wallet that works with Polygon. MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are the easiest ones to use for beginners.Read more: Get Started With DESK: How to Set Up Your WalletDo I need to create a CoinDesk account to use DESK?Yes. With the new release in Dec. 2022, you will be required to have a coindesk.com account.What is the problem you’re trying to solve?In the Web2 era, content creators – be they writers, artists, filmmakers, publishers, media outlets or event organizers – have become beholden to the algorithms of intermediating platforms, complicating their efforts to directly reach and engage audiences. Simply put, the web ended up replacing one set of gatekeepers (major newspapers, magazines and television networks) with another (social media and search engines).We’re hopeful, like many others, that crypto and Web3 solutions involving tokens and new data and governance models will facilitate a more direct relationship with our audience and the expansion of a community of engaged participants that is independent of the platforms.We believe Consensus, which moves the content creator-audience relationship out of the digital realm and into a physical space where internet gatekeepers have less influence, is a great place to experiment with new tokens and incentive models in pursuit of this goal.We hope DESK generates a community that engages year-round in rich interaction with each other and with CoinDesk articles and other content and then comes back each year to gather in person at this cornerstone annual event.Why do you need a blockchain for loyalty points?Social tokens allow for community-driven tech by creating a feedback loop between product creators and product users. This will allow the DESK team to get real-time data on engagement based on DESK usage, and use that data to iterate on the DESK ecosystem, aligning it more and more to user needs and wants.Initially, the blockchain provides us with data on DESK usage. The blockchain also discourages insider deals or under-the-table giveaways because the public ledger would lay bare any such misbehavior. This means everyone who claims NFTs or physical rewards had to put in the work (engaging with our content) to earn their reward.Simply put: DESK will be used to align our efforts as a media and events company to the wants and needs of our audience.Will DESK increase in value?No. DESK is not a currency, nor is it a financial asset or investment product of any kind. It is not for speculation and will not make anyone rich. This is not a vehicle for anyone’s savings nor is it a money-making opportunity.Why doesn’t DESK have monetary value?It is a reward token, analogous to airline frequent-flier miles, hotel guest points and the like. CoinDesk will be taking strong measures to discourage its use for speculation or trading.By providing a system where users can contribute to the functioning of a collective, digital system, the blockchain lays the foundation for a new type of organization: the tokenized community. We've seen examples of this over the past few years with NFT communities and distributed autonomous organizations (DAO). To highlight this blockchain use case, we decided to focus on activating and expanding social utility to create community value, instead of focusing on monetization.Can I mine DESK?No. DESK can only be earned as a reward for engaging with CoinDesk events and content, or as a tip from fellow users.Can I stake my DESK to earn more tokens?No. See above.Is CoinDesk using DESK to raise funds?No. We're not selling the token at all, just distributing it to audience members as a reward for their engagement.If the token is on mainnet, what’s to stop anyone from listing it on an exchange or trading it?Listing, buying or trading DESK is against our terms of use because we want the rewards and value to come from inside the ecosystem. We reserve the right to ban accounts and blacklist wallet addresses that violate our terms of use.Banning? Blacklisting? That doesn’t sound very decentralized. What gives?It’s important to remember that not all blockchain assets are fully decentralized or claim to be so. Ether, the native currency of Ethereum, is completely user-controlled, but ERC-20 tokens built on top of the network may or may not be, depending on how the issuer designs it. For example, a number of regulated stablecoins are ERC-20 tokens, and their issuers have the power to freeze funds of suspect addresses to comply with law enforcement requests.So, no, DESK is not decentralized, nor does it purport to be. It is not competing with bitcoin or ether.OK, but if DESK has no monetary value how did taco stands or bars in Austin accept it during Consensus 2022?Part of the value DESK provides is what CoinDesk injects into the ecosystem when we want to reward our users for engaging at a deeper level. This means being able to use your DESK to redeem food and drinks at establishments that CoinDesk partners with on the ground.Are there gas (on-chain computation) fees for using DESK?No. The DESK ecosystem is 100% gasless.How?CoinDesk is covering the gas costs on Polygon.What if I got DESK in 2021 at the virtual Consensus? Can I still use it?Because DESK has transitioned from testnet to mainnet, DESK collected in 2021 is no longer usable. That being said, we value the feedback and effort from DESK's beta testers.Who are the 'Piranhas'?Piranhas are the fledgling community that formed around DESK during Consensus 2021. They started their own Discord channel and created memes about the token. The phenomenon was a clear validation for CoinDesk of the concept.At Consensus 2022, the official hub of the DESK community was CoinDesk’s Discord server, where we welcomed the Piranhas and newcomers alike.Who built DESK?CoinDesk did, with the help of several key external partners, including Coinvise and others.Which wallets support DESK?As mentioned, MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet are easiest to use, but any wallet that works on Polygon can be used.How do I connect my DESK wallet to my CoinDesk account?Navigate to the DESK dashboard. Select ""Create or Connect Wallet"" and approve the transaction in your wallet.Are DESK transactions anonymous?Depends. CoinDesk can associate identities with wallets only when users create accounts on desk.coindesk.com. We will not use this data for anything other than authenticating users when they sign on or distributing DESK rewards, we will never sell it, and we will protect user information assiduously. (See our privacy policy.) DESK transactions will appear on DESK's page on the Polyscan block explorer, but only the wallet addresses will be displayed.Do I need to report DESK transactions on my taxes?DESK has no inherent monetary value, but, whether or not you live in a jurisdiction where utility tokens are deemed taxable, you should consult a tax professional if you have concerns.How do I keep up with DESK updates?We’ll keep a record of airdrops, product developments and other updates critical to DESK’s roadmap and tokenomics in our DESK product blog.You can also keep abreast of DESK updates in our Discord server.What’s the future of DESK?The latest release is only the beginning in developing our Web3 model for DESK on coindesk.com. We'll be working on improving our wallet functionality, currently in beta, and looking forward to seeing what data and reader feedback reveal as to how to continue improving the experienceThis article was originally published on Dec 9, 2022 at 2:08 p.m. UTCDisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

52,BlockFi’s Rise and Fall: A Timeline,https://www.coindesk.com/learn/blockfis-rise-and-fall-a-timeline/,"LearnBlockFi’s Rise and Fall: A TimelineBlockFi’s Rise and Fall: A TimelineBlockFi co-founders Flori Marquez and Zac Prince (BlockFi)BlockFi’s Rise and Fall: A TimelineBlockFi, a crypto lending company, was founded in October 2017 and filed for bankruptcy just over five years later in the wake of FTX's collapse. By Robert StevensShare on FacebookShare on LinkedInShare on XBeginnerCrypto lender BlockFi is kaput. The platform, which offered high yields on crypto deposits, has filed for bankruptcy protection. It’s the latest company to fall after the catastrophic collapse of FTX. Indeed, bankruptcy filings show that BlockFi had $355 million worth of cryptocurrencies frozen in FTX and relied on the firm for its credit facility. But how did it all go so wrong? CoinDesk has compiled a timeline to help you piece together the picture.October 2017 – BlockFi beginsZac Prince and Flori Marquez founded BlockFi in October 2017 with a lofty mission: provide credit services to the cryptocurrency market. Prince, the CEO, had worked in sales before founding BlockFi. Marquez, the company’s chief operating officer, managed financial portfolios for Bond Street, a small-time lender that Goldman Sachs acquired in 2017, before founding BlockFi. The firm set up shop in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in subsequent years expanded to New York, Singapore, Poland and Argentina. In January 2018, BlockFi launched its first offering: loans of U.S. dollars backed by cryptocurrencies. Simply, clients could deposit bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) and take out loans in fiat against that crypto collateral.February 2018 to December 2018 – BlockFi’s first funding roundsVenture capital money followed swiftly. In February 2018, BlockFi raised $1.55 million in a seed round led by ConsenSys Ventures. In July 2018, it raised a hefty $52.5 million in a funding round led by Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital. And at the end of 2018, BlockFi raised another $4 million by issuing convertible notes, with Akuna Capital the main buyer.March 2019 – BlockFi offers compound interest accountFlush with cash, the startup got to work. In March 2019 it launched a crypto deposit account that would reinvest earnings from bitcoin or ether deposits and provide an opportunity to earn compound interest at a 6.2% annual percentage yield (APY). BlockFi adjusted these rates over time; oin May 2019 it almost halved the interest rate on ETH deposits. The risk of the high-interest account, as explained to CoinDesk, was that it ""doesn’t come with the backing of the federal government like a savings account at a bank does.” As the market heated up over the next few years and BlockFi continued to grow, that didn’t seem to hold people back from depositing their money with the company.August 2019 - Series A fundingThe firm’s next huge cash injection came in August 2019, when BlockFi raised $18.3 million in a Series A funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures. They were joined by Winklevoss Capital, Galaxy Digital, ConsenSys, Akuna Capital and others. Earlier that year, BlockFi reached a milestone of having over $50 million deposited in its interest-bearing accounts.December 2019 – BlockFi expands into tradingIn December 2019, BlockFi got into the crypto trading game, offering an unusual model that charged zero fees on purchases and sales. Instead of charging trading fees, BlockFi profited by selling trading data to institutional crypto firms that, in turn, provided liquidity to BlockFi, similar to Robinhood’s business model. “Market makers want the information about what trades are happening, and they get it by having relationships with as many venues as they can support to receive that order flow,” BlockFi’s CEO said.February 2020 - Series B funding roundPeter Thiel’s Valar Ventures led BlockFi’s $30 million Series B funding round in February 2020, with repeat investors including Akuna Capital and new investors including HashKey Capital, which CEO Prince noted as key to helping “BlockFi expand into Singapore” and the Asia-Pacific region.March 2020 - Cash on-ramps arriveBlockFi partnered with Silvergate Bank to allow customers to utilize cash deposits  via wire transfer to buy bitcoin. Prior to the move, BlockFi was limited to “crypto payment rails” such as stablecoins. Prince said he had been inundated by “requests every day from our existing clients, and also from folks who aren't already cryptocurrency owners.” The company disclosed the previous month it had $650 million of assets on its platform.May 2020 - BlockFi suffers minor hackAll was going well. Then: a hack! In 2020, a single attacker targeted an employee’s phone with a “SIM swap” that tricked the mobile carrier into activating the employee’s phone on another device. This allowed the hacker to gain access to some of BlockFi’s retail marketing systems. No funds were lost, but the attacker managed to access confidential information about BlockFi’s customers.August 2020 – BlockFi gets more fundingIn August 2020, BlockFi raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Morgan Creek Digital. At the time, Zac Prince said the lender held $1.5 billion in assets and made a little under $10 million in revenue each month. National Basketball Association star Matthew Dellavedova was among the investors.October 2020 – BlockFi makes a risky betIn October 2020, BlockFi invested big into Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk's parent, Digital Currency Group), taking a 5% stake of the $4.8 billion fund. The other big whale invested in GBTC at the time? Hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which had a 6% stake as of June 2020.BlockFi continued to expand its stake in GBTC, to $1.7 billion in GBTC by February 2021. Unfortunately, it later turned out that it was difficult to get money out of GBTC. In addition, as of writing, shares in the trust trade at a huge discount to bitcoin.January 2021 - BlockFi’s bitcoin ambitionsEarly in 2021, BlockFi registered its own Bitcoin Trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, putting it in direct competition with Grayscale’s product. The fund offered a lower management fee and partnered with Fidelity Digital Asset Services to custody the assets. In November of that same year, it filed for approval for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.March 2021 – BlockFi gets new funding, $3B valuationAll was going well for BlockFi. With bitcoin’s soaring price hitting all-time highs (bitcoin crossed the $60,000 mark for the first time in March 2021), BlockFi raised $350 million, giving the company a valuation of $3 billion. It held $15 billion in assets and aimed to increase its staff to 500 people by the end of the year. It said it had 225,000 users, up from 10,000 in late 2019. What could go wrong?July 2021 – Bad timing amid an onslaught of cease and desist ordersNew Jersey’s Bureau of Securities was the first to deliver a big blow. The state’s financial regulator claimed BlockFi’s interest accounts amounted to sales of an “unregistered security” and issued a ban on creating new interest-bearing accounts. Alabama issued its own notice to the lender shortly after, and Texas joined on the same day. Two days later, Vermont lodged its complaint, and at the end of the month Kentucky ordered the lender to stop signing up new interest account customers.The CEO called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to look into the matter. So the national securities regulator did exactly that – and it didn’t end well for BlockFi (we’ll get to that next). It was poor timing for BlockFi, which was looking to raise $500 million in a Series E and was launching a Visa rewards credit card.February 2022 – BlockFi settles with the SECIn February, BlockFi settled with the SEC for $100 million over its high-yield lending product. It registered with the SEC, but from mid-February stopped offering the interest account to new clients in the U.S., and prevented existing U.S. clients from adding more money to their accounts. “Today’s settlement makes clear that crypto markets must comply with time-tested securities laws,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement.Summer 2022 – BlockFi spirals downwardIn June, BlockFi’s valuation sank to $1 billion in a “down round” – a third of its $3 billion valuation the previous March, when it raised $350 million. At the end of June, the lender held $1.8 billion in open loans and $600 million of exposure. In particular, BlockFi had made huge loans to the huge crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which officially filed for bankruptcy protection on July 1. Three Arrows had failed after being overexposed to the collapsed stablecoin ecosystem, Terra; BlockFi, according to reports, had liquidated the hedge fund's collateral before its bankruptcy. In the same month, bitcoin fell below $20,000. A month later, BlockFi’s main rivals, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network, also filed for bankruptcy protection.In dire straits, BlockFi received a $400 million line of credit from crypto exchange FTX later that summer. The exchange also won the right for its U.S. unit to buy BlockFi FTX US almost bought the lender for just $25 million, and in August could have bought the company for as little as $15 million if certain key terms weren’t met, such as receiving SEC clearance to operate its yield-generating services in the U.S.November 2022 – FTX collapse slams BlockFi, firm files for bankruptcyAt the start of the month, FTX itself collapsed after CoinDesk published a story based on private financial documents on Nov. 2 that poked holes in the balance sheet of FTX sister company, trading firm Alameda Research. It took only nine more days for FTX to completely melt down, and it went to bankruptcy court on Nov. 11.That was bad for BlockFi, which needed FTX’s credit facility to remain afloat. Late on Nov. 10, BlockFi paused customer withdrawals amid “the lack of clarity” about FTX. On Nov. 11, California’s financial regulator revoked BlockFi’s lending license.BlockFi started preparing for its bankruptcy filing shortly after that. On Nov. 28, it officially filed for protection under Chapter 11, leaving over 100,000 creditors in the lurch. Filings later revealed that Alameda had defaulted on $680 million worth of loans to BlockFi. After filing in the bankruptcy court, BlockFi sued Sam Bankman-Fried's Emergent Fidelity Technologies for its Robinhood shares, which were pledged to BlockFi as collateral for a loan.In the first bankruptcy hearing, lawyers for BlockFi said the lender held $355 million in crypto on FTX.

53,What Are 'Fully Backed' Reserves?,https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-fully-backed-reserves/,"LearnWhat Are 'Fully Backed' Reserves?What Are 'Fully Backed' Reserves?(Unsplash, modified by CoinDesk)What Are 'Fully Backed' Reserves?More people are calling for crypto companies and those behind products such as stablecoins to prove they have enough funds to pay their customers.By Robert StevensUpdated Nov 23, 2022 at 8:08 p.m. UTCShare on FacebookShare on LinkedInShare on XBeginnerRegular banks do not actually hold all of your money. They lend out most of your deposits in an attempt to eke out returns from financial markets. This works, for the most part, because the bank insures deposits with the federal government and because the bank widely diversifies its exposure to risk to ensure that it won’t be caught short in the event of a financial crash.This system occasionally fails in traditional finance (see: Lehman) but fails frequently in crypto. The government does not insure deposits to crypto platforms and the platforms often do not manage risk particularly well (see: FTX, Voyager Digital, Celsius Network), making high-risk bets that end in catastrophe.Read More: Proof of Reserves: Could it Have Prevented the FTX Meltdown?After so many platforms squandered customer funds, crypto traders are thinking twice about depositing funds to crypto exchanges and lending institutions that “rehypothecate” uninsured deposits – which means they repurpose customer money and lend the funds out in the markets. A safer bet looks like trading on platforms that “fully back” their reserves. But what does this really mean, and should such claims be taken with a pinch of salt?Fully backed, explainedWhen a financial product, such as a stablecoin or depositary institution, claims to “fully back” its reserves, it means that it has stored enough money behind a product, like a stablecoin or a customer’s trading account, to support its worth.So, a crypto exchange that “fully backs” its reserves should always be able to pay out customer withdrawals, no matter the state of the market. One such example is Coinbase, which does not lend out its customers’ funds without their express permission, meaning it should always have enough money on hand to prevent a bank run.A stablecoin that “fully backs” its reserves is always able to fulfill conversions to the original asset, no matter what. One example is wBTC, or wrapped bitcoin, which holds real bitcoin (BTC) in a cold wallet, then issues an equal amount of an Ethereum-based version of the coin that trades as an ERC-20 token.Fully backed, however, does not necessarily mean that assets are held one to one. That claim refers to the idea that if you, say, give me a dollar, I’ll hold that dollar as a dollar and won’t turn it into something else. Lots of stablecoins that claim to be fully backed, like U.S.-dollar stablecoin USDC, are not backed one to one.This is because the companies that issue USDC hold the deposits of real U.S. dollars in “cash and cash equivalents.” Cash equivalents refer to U.S. Treasury bonds, which is debt issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. These bonds, which pay small returns to holders over time, are close enough to the worth of actual U.S. dollars that the market accepts bonds being essentially worth the same.But “fully backed” does not always mean that the backing can withstand financial shocks. U.S. dollar stablecoin tether (USDT) also claims that its reserves are fully backed, but this backing is secured by “other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether [the issuing company] to third parties.” So, USDT may be fully backed, but it is partially backed by loans to other crypto companies.Until October 2022, USDT was also backed by commercial paper – short-term commercial debt to other companies – and moved those funds to U.S. Treasurys. The concern about the commercial paper was that nobody knew which companies Tether was using to back USDT, so it was impossible to determine the worth of that backing. What’s more, its “fully backed” claim has historically turned out not to be true after it emerged in 2019 that USDT was, at one point, only 74% backed. As wrote the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Dawn D. Stump, the claim that it was backed to the U.S. dollar was “not 100% true, 100% of the time.”Read more: What Is Tether? How USDT Works and What Backs Its ValueSome stablecoins do not fully back their reserves, which has led to catastrophic results in some cases. The popular algorithmic stablecoin UST, for instance, crashed in spectacular fashion, wiping billions from the market.On the opposite end of the spectrum, U.S. dollar stablecoin DAI overcollateralizes its reserves with crypto, meaning it has more than enough crypto on hand to back its coin. DAI has survived several market crashes.This article was originally published on Nov 22, 2022 at 11:04 p.m. UTCDisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The bank said it disagreed.“Private investors and individuals have propagated both gold and bitcoin year-to-date rather than shifting from the former to the latter,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.“Beyond retail investors, speculative institutional investors such as hedge funds including momentum traders such as CTAs appear to have also propagated the rally by buying both gold and bitcoin futures since February, perhaps more heavily than retail investors,” the authors wrote.The bank’s analysis shows a “sharp position build-up since February of $7b in bitcoin futures and $30b in gold futures.”The risk of mean reversion looks high, the bank said, which means both assets could fall back toward their average levels.Software developer MicroStrategy (MSTR), which has a corporate strategy of buying bitcoin, also played a part in amplifying the rally, the bank said. The company has bought over $1 billion of bitcoin this year, adding to the more than $1 billion acquired in the last quarter of 2023, the report noted.“We believe the debt-funded bitcoin purchases by MicroStrategy add leverage and froth to the current crypto rally and raise the risk of more severe deleveraging in a potential downturn in the future,” the report said.Read more: Bitcoin Is Unlikely to Match Gold’s Allocation in Investors’ Portfolios in Nominal Terms: JPMorganEdited by Sheldon Reback.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

It allows users to create their own layer 2 networks and drives the value of its native BVM tokens.Developers told CoinDesk that the team plans ""juicy"" airdrops for BVM stakers, which could fuel demand for the tokens.Bitcoin Virtual Machine, a protocol founded late February, is gaining traction among traders betting on the general growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem, driving demand for its BVM tokens.Data shows that the project’s BVM tokens have added 35% in the past 24 hours, beating a general market decline. The CoinDesk 20 Index fell 5.3% in the same period. The tokens have surged to $3.5 from an intitial of 20 cents on March 8.The project lets users spin up their own layer-2 networks on the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin and Ethereum are known as layer-1 protocols, and attempts to scale and expand them are layer 2s. While the Ethereum ecosystem has had multiple layer 2 projects aimed at providing faster, cheaper transactions for years, the Bitcoin version really kicked off only in 2023 following the introduction of Ordinals technology.The value propositions for the token are driven by staking rewards for BVM holders and a cut of fees generated by the service, developer @punk3700 told CoinDesk in a direct message interview on X.“We have 40%-50% circulating staked by our holders. Working on a few airdrop deals for BVM stakers,” @punk3700 said. “Some of them could be quite juicy.”On Friday, the team said Naka Chain, a Bitcoin layer-2 build on BVM, will airdrop 10.5 million tokens to BVM token stakers. The airdrop is proportional to a user’s staked holdings and will be locked for three months.Tokens based on the Bitcoin blockchain first started to emerge as an investment thesis in mid-2023, led by Ordinals technology and BRC-20 tokens.The BRC-20 standard (BRC stands for Bitcoin Request for Comment) was introduced in April and allowed users to issue transferable tokens directly through the network for the first time. The tokens, called inscriptions, function on the Ordinals Protocol. That protocol allows users to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small bitcoin-based transactions.@punk3700 previously told CoinDesk that bitcoin’s usage in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications has so far been limited to tokenized representations of bitcoin on other chains, such as Ethereum or Solana, but that there’s a gap for wealthy bitcoin holders to use their assets on native applications, fueling the investment thesis.The BRC-20 tokens have a cumulative $3.5 billion market capitalization as of Friday, CoinGecko data shows.Edited by Sheldon Reback.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Sen. Laphonza Butler (D-CA) write that a FINRA survey disclosed that 70% of brokers’ communications with retail investors violated fair disclosure rules.“Brokers’ communications falsely equated cryptocurrency with cash; in others, they provided misleading explanations of cryptocurrency’s risks,” they wrote. “These alarming deficiencies raise significant concerns that brokers and advisers may now provide incomplete and deceptive information about bitcoin ETPs to retail investors.”The Senators also argue that by naming bitcoin exchange-traded funds as such, the name “obfuscates important characteristics about these investments.”“Retail investors should be made aware of how these ETPs differ from more common funds which they may have experience,” they said in the letter, writing that bitcoin is not subject to the same protections under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that ETFs which hold shares of various companies would have.The two lawmakers also say that bitcoin (BTC) – which they call the most established and scrutinized cryptocurrency – is displaying weakness, and other cryptos are far more susceptible to misconduct.“We do not believe that other cryptocurrencies show the trading volumes or integrity to support associated ETPs,” they wrote. “Retail investors would face enormous risks from ETPs…whose prices are especially susceptible to pump-and-dump or other fraudulent schemes.”Coinbase’s Paul Grewal hits back“Respectfully, Senators, the evidence points exactly the opposite way,” Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal wrote in a post on X.Grewal pointed out that ether (ETH), thought to be the next digital asset to have an ETF, has a higher trading volume than many S&P 500 stocks.“ETH’s spot market is deep and liquid,” he wrote. “Only one S&P 500 stock has lower adjusted bid-ask spreads,” Grewal added that Coinbase had addressed the senators’ concerns when it sent a 27-page comment letter to the SEC.“Crypto is an important building block in updating our financial system for everyone,” he concluded.Edited by Parikshit Mishra.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

The mem coins jumped as much as 60% after Avalanche’s disclosure, beating a general market-wide drop.DEXTools data further shows a bump in trading volumes on Avalanche tokens alongside a rise in the issuance of new meme tokens, likely in hopes of a new cult becoming the next Foundation pick.Following the disclosure, volumes on the Avalanche exchange Trader Joe grew to $65 million on Thursday from $53 million on Wednesday, although these volumes include all tokens.Avalanche referred to these meme tokens as community coins. “Community coins have become vital Web3 touchstones today. They represent the fun, spirit, uniqueness, and interests of diverse crypto communities,” it stated.COQ was among Avalanche’s runaway meme hits in December amid a meme coin frenzy. A single trader acquired just over $450 worth of COQ shortly after its issuance and managed to turn it into over $2.5 million in a few weeks, with thousands of hopeful memes deployed on the network later on to emulate COQ’s apparent success.Meme coins are often considered a scammy part of the market among blockchain purists, but the success of this niche—led by investments from prominent blockchain teams—could be starting to change the stigma associated with investing in such tokens.Edited by Parikshit Mishra.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

""Even if you don't have an ETF that can offer staking as a part of it, it's still a cash producing asset, so I think ETH could make more sense as an asset to more people than Bitcoin does.”As the Ethereum uses a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, holders of ether can earn yield by ""staking"" or putting their tokens to work on the blockchain. On Coinbase, for instance, ETH stakers can earn about a 3% yield.Still, the odds of SEC approval of spot ETH products are far from assured.

The 0% remains in place until March 2025 or the fund gets up to $1.5 billion in AUM..“Initially we were one of the few that did not do a short term waiver, we came out very aggressively at a low fee right from the start and I had always thought that that was the right level to be at but I think our thinking was that historically with ETF launches, the short term waivers have not gone over that well and frankly, they can be a little confusing, and maybe have a lack of transparency as to how they work,” said Kyle DaCruz, director of digital assets products at VanEck.“But we listened to our investors and it’s clear that that was important to investors in the market so we shifted,"" he continued. “Relative, we’d like to do better and part of that initiative is that fee waiver.”The move so far is an apparent success. In the roughly two months from launch until the fee trimming this week, HODL had attracted about 4,300 bitcoin and just shy of $300 million in AUM. In the handful of days since, the fund has ballooned to more than 7,200 bitcoin and $527 million in AUM.That level places HOLD fifth in AUM among the nine new spot bitcoin ETFs (excepting Grayscale's GBTC), behind BlackRock, Fidelity, ARK/21Shares and Bitwise, and ahead of Invesco/Galaxy, Franklin Templeton, Valkyrie and WisdomTree.Currently, only about 1% of the firm’s AUM is in crypto, but VanEck CEO Jan Van Eck would like that number to be much larger, according to Kanade.“Jan’s aspiration is to have crypto be 15% of the AUM base one day in the future,” he said. “Sooner rather than later.”Edited by Stephen Alpher.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

These are usually shared between the client and the vendor, which keeps control of the custody process. In contrast, Cordial puts the whole process under the control of the customer, co-founder Sebastian Higgs said in an interview.The bankruptcies of crypto companies such as crypto exchange FTX, leaving customers without access to their assets, helped drive institutions toward self-custodial products and technologies, among them MPC. While that means the assets are no longer kept centrally by one organization, it still leaves the custodian with a degree of control.“We give all the software to the customer side, not just a bit of the key. So they basically run everything on their side,” Higgs said. “We reduce ourselves to a simple vendor/supplier relationship where we just do code updates. You don't need us to sign things, you don't need us to change things on a day-to-day operational basis, you're fully independent. I think for firms like Jump, who have a lot of regulatory oversight, that solves a lot of headaches.”Cordial Treasury currently supports over 30 blockchains including all bitcoin and relevant forks, Ethereum and other EVM chains, the Polkadot ecosystem, Cosmos ecosystem, Provenance, Aptos and Sui. Other networks have the capability to be added in as short as one week, according to a press release.Alex Davies, CTO of Jump Trading, said Cordial Treasury helped scale Jump’s digital asset business, and the trading firm is also happy to be an investor in Cordial Systems. Details of the investment were not disclosed.“We host Cordial Treasury in a highly available and secure configuration as part of our proprietary technology stack,"" he said in a statement.

A coterie of crypto startups on Solana are preparing to airdrop new tokens to their users, including Wormhole's W, and Tensor's TNSR. Their token holders will get to vote on the future of the project.But these so-called governance tokens are fundamentally financial assets. They trade on unregulated exchanges where buyers and sellers are filled – often chaotically – by market makers and algorithms. The first moments of their trading lives are often highly volatile. How does one price an asset that didn't exist before?Cindy Leow, Drift's co-founder said traders and market makers have generally followed a stilted logic: price the token at the project's most recent valuation and add ""some sort of premium.""  To find the premium (or something close to it) traders could use a pre-launch market.""If it's an efficient market it should price [tokens] well enough to launch close to the starting price,"" she said in a recent interview with CoinDesk conducted over Telegram.But there are risks that come with this kind of product. While spot and futures exchanges can get their price data from a variety of sources, Drift's pre launch market will only be able to reference itself. It will thus be vulnerable to manipulation that if left unchecked could force a liquidation cascade across the entire protocol.Drift is putting liquidation guardrails up that will stymie runaway prices, according to a blog post. It will also require traders to settle up any debts they've accrued on other trading products, some of which allow for risky leveraged positions.""Having a fair, liquid market is even harder for pre-launch markets than it is for memecoins,"" Leow said. But Drift nonetheless has signed a few market makers up to back these contracts.Pre-launch markets aren't a new concept in DeFi though they have not yet taken hold in Solana. Demand for these services aren't sky-high, either, according to Leow. She estimates Drift's market could see less than $1 million in daily volume if it follows the trend set on other chains.""But the interesting thing is that people reference these prices a lot on social media,"" she said.Edited by Nikhilesh De.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Creators using MyShell will be able to host their models on Ritual and register them as IP Assets on Story Protocol, ensuring control over usage, attribution, and revenue sharing.After raising more than $54 million last year from the likes of Andreessen Horowitz and Paris Hilton's 11:11 Media, Story Protocol, a blockchain-based platform focused on intellectual property (IP) rights, says it will be used by the crypto-meets-AI startup Ritual to let builders create AI models and track their outputs on-chain.Under the so-called partnership, Ritual will begin posting its user-made AI models to Story Protocol to ""prove that outputs like text, image, and voice are generated by specific models"" and provide ""advanced watermarking schemes that will give developers stronger security guarantees around provenance and traceability,"" Story Protocol said in a statement. According to Story Protocol co-founder Jason Zhao, a new software development kit (SDK) is also in the works that will allow Ritual developers to seamlessly register their models as ""IP Assets"" on Story Protocol.Story Protocol pitches itself as a ""programmable IP layer"" that creators can use to keep track of their IP to ensure it is paid for when used and properly attributed. Currently in beta testing on Ethereum's Sepolia test network, Story Protocol was a cat-nip for investors last year with its pitch infusing the ""code-is-law"" tenants of blockchain with broad overtures toward Web3 and the creator economy.Its partnership with Ritual, a decentralized computing platform that raised $25 million last year in a bid to help developers build and run AI models, comes as AI talk is dominating the crypto realm along with the wider tech industry. Investor money is flooding faster than ever into AI-linked blockchain projects, and a new category of ""AI Tokens"" has surged recently with the tech stock of the moment, Nvidia (NVDA).By collaborating, Ritual and Story Protocol's leaders seem hopeful that crossing AI with blockchain-based property rights might present the crypto industry with its surest bet yet towards seizing hype around both sectors.""Even though we've brought media on-chain, we haven't brought IP on-chain, because IP is rights plus media. It's not just media alone,"" said Zhao, who worked as a product manager at Google's Deep Mind AI lab before starting Story Protocol. According to Zhao, Story Protocol has introduced ""programmable IP"" by ""allowing people to attach the sort of rules for engagement and the rights to each piece of IP on-chain so that it can move across different apps and different platforms.""With Story Protocol, Zhao says the rules governing how IP should be used and paid for can be hard-coded into smart contracts. Zhao says those contracts can help people create derivative works from IP without fear of infringement and can ensure IP holders get automatically compensated for their work when others use it.""We see ourselves as providing more efficient rails, or infrastructure, for licensing IP than the traditional pen and paper world,"" said Zhao.The first project to take advantage of the Ritual-Story partnership will be MyShell, a generative platform that people can use to build AI apps and chatbots based on made-up characters. MyShell users will be able to host their models on Ritual and then register them as IP Assets on Story Protocol.""By partnering with MyShell, Story Protocol allows creators to have control over the AI use cases they create, where attribution, authorized remixing, and revenue sharing are all captured on-chain,"" Story Protocol said in its statement.Edited by Nikhilesh De.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Sen. Laphonza Butler (D-CA) write that a FINRA survey disclosed that 70% of brokers’ communications with retail investors violated fair disclosure rules.“Brokers’ communications falsely equated cryptocurrency with cash; in others, they provided misleading explanations of cryptocurrency’s risks,” they wrote. “These alarming deficiencies raise significant concerns that brokers and advisers may now provide incomplete and deceptive information about bitcoin ETPs to retail investors.”The Senators also argue that by naming bitcoin exchange-traded funds as such, the name “obfuscates important characteristics about these investments.”“Retail investors should be made aware of how these ETPs differ from more common funds which they may have experience,” they said in the letter, writing that bitcoin is not subject to the same protections under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that ETFs which hold shares of various companies would have.The two lawmakers also say that bitcoin (BTC) – which they call the most established and scrutinized cryptocurrency – is displaying weakness, and other cryptos are far more susceptible to misconduct.“We do not believe that other cryptocurrencies show the trading volumes or integrity to support associated ETPs,” they wrote. “Retail investors would face enormous risks from ETPs…whose prices are especially susceptible to pump-and-dump or other fraudulent schemes.”Coinbase’s Paul Grewal hits back“Respectfully, Senators, the evidence points exactly the opposite way,” Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal wrote in a post on X.Grewal pointed out that ether (ETH), thought to be the next digital asset to have an ETF, has a higher trading volume than many S&P 500 stocks.“ETH’s spot market is deep and liquid,” he wrote. “Only one S&P 500 stock has lower adjusted bid-ask spreads,” Grewal added that Coinbase had addressed the senators’ concerns when it sent a 27-page comment letter to the SEC.“Crypto is an important building block in updating our financial system for everyone,” he concluded.Edited by Parikshit Mishra.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

El Salvador stored the cold wallet ""in a physical vault within our national territory,"" he said, including a photo of a wallet that held 5,689.68 BTC, worth $411 million at Thursday's prices.A bitcoin treasury of that size places El Salvador's holdings far higher than previously believed. Even on Thursday, public trackers place the nation's trove at less than 3,000 BTC ($205 million). Earlier this week Buckle teased that the country was not simply buying BTC but also getting it by selling passports,  through currency conversions for businesses, from mining and from government services.The revelation represents the first time that Bukele has tied his nation's holdings to a specific address. He previously relied solely on social media posts to make claims about the size of his trove, providing occasional updates whenever El Salvador bought more.El Salvador became the first country to purchase bitcoin as a treasury asset in September 2021, when a single coin cost around $52,000. On Thursday BTC prices were north of $72,000, though in the past 24 hours the asset has traded above $73,000 and as low as $68,000.The on-chain transfers into El Salvador's cold wallet occurred over the past week, though the majority arrived Thursday. Most of the bitcoin held in that wallet came from Bitfinex, according to Arkham Intelligence.Edited by Nikhilesh De.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

When asked which U.S. political party they trust to tackle the issues around crypto, almost half of the voters polled – 49% – picked ""neither.""""Large numbers of voters are looking for policymakers who can boldly light a path forward on crypto policy,"" Paradigm's Justin Slaughter and Dominique Little wrote in a blog entry describing the poll's results.In another point of industry reflection, more than one in 10 of those polled said they've either already bought a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) (6%) or are going to (6%). This could further demonstrate that the recent approval of the bitcoin spot ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission isn't only drawing the eyes of institutional investors.The presidential election is eight months away, though the primaries have already rounded up sufficient support to make Biden and Trump the expected nominees of the two major parties. Other polling on the general election have the two running neck-and-neck, with Trump often enjoying a slight edge.Read More: U.S. President Again Proposes Crypto Mining Tax, 'Wash Sale Rule' for Digital Assets in New BudgetDisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.
